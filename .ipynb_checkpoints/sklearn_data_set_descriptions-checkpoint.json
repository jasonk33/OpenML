The exact meaning of the features and classes is largely unknown. Annealing, in metallurgy and materials science, is a heat treatment that alters the physical and sometimes chemical properties of a material to increase its ductility and reduce its hardness, making it more workable. It involves heating a material to above its recrystallization temperature, maintaining a suitable temperature, and then cooling.

Relevant Information:\n       The dataset format is described below.  Note: the format of this\n     database was modified on 2/26/90 to conform with the format of all\n     the other databases in the UCI repository of machine learning databases.\n \n 5. Number of Instances: 3196 total\n \n 6. Number of Attributes: 36\n \n 7. Attribute Summaries:\n     Classes (2):  -- White-can-win (\"won\") and White-cannot-win (\"nowin\").\n           I believe that White is deemed to be unable to win if the Black pawn\n           can safely advance.\n     Attributes: see Shapiro's book.\n \n 8. Missing Attributes: --  none\n \n 9. Class Distribution:\n     In 1669 of the positions (52%), White can win.\n     In 1527 of the positions (48%), White cannot win.\n \n The format for instances in this database is a sequence of 37 attribute values.\n Each instance is a board-descriptions for this chess endgame.  The first\n 36 attributes describe the board.  The last (37th) attribute is the\n classification: \"win\" or \"nowin\".

TITLE: \n  Letter Image Recognition Data \n \n    The objective is to identify each of a large number of black-and-white\n    rectangular pixel displays as one of the 26 capital letters in the English\n    alphabet.  The character images were based on 20 different fonts and each\n    letter within these 20 fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of\n    20,000 unique stimuli.  Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive\n    numerical attributes (statistical moments and edge counts) which were then\n    scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0 through 15.  We\n    typically train on the first 16000 items and then use the resulting model\n    to predict the letter category for the remaining 4000.

Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.\n\n### Relevant papers:  \nM.

The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System &#40;RIS&#41; data. Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data. Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types). \n\nThis study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices. \n\nSome background information for these four wilderness areas: Neota (area 2) probably has the highest mean elevational value of the 4 wilderness areas. Rawah (area 1) and Comanche Peak (area 3) would have a lower mean elevational value, while Cache la Poudre (area 4) would have the lowest mean elevational value. \n\nAs for primary major tree species in these areas, Neota would have spruce/fir (type 1), while Rawah and Comanche Peak would probably have lodgepole pine (type 2) as their primary species, followed by spruce/fir and aspen (type 5). Cache la Poudre would tend to have Ponderosa pine (type 3), Douglas-fir (type 6), and cottonwood/willow (type 4). \n\nThe Rawah and Comanche Peak areas would tend to be more typical of the overall dataset than either the Neota or Cache la Poudre, due to their assortment of tree species and range of predictive variable values (elevation, etc.) Cache la Poudre would probably be more unique than the others, due to its relatively low elevation range and species composition.\n\nAttribute Information:  \nGiven is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description.

The aim is to predict this classification, given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database, the class of a pixel is coded as a number. \n\nOne frame of Landsat MSS imagery consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands. Two of these are in the visible region (corresponding approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum) and two are in the (near) infra-red. Each pixel is a 8-bit binary word, with 0 corresponding to black and 255 to white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is about 80m x 80m. Each image contains 2340 x 3380 such pixels. \n\nThe database is a (tiny) sub-area of a scene, consisting of 82 x 100 pixels. Each line of data corresponds to a 3x3 square neighbourhood of pixels completely contained within the 82x100 sub-area. Each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands (converted to ASCII) of each of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighbourhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel. \n\nEach pixel is categorized as one of the following classes:  \n1 red soil  \n2 cotton crop  \n3 grey soil  \n4 damp grey soil  \n5 soil with vegetation stubble  \n6 mixture class (all types present)  \n7 very damp grey soil  \n\nNB. There are no examples with class 6 in this dataset.  \n\nThe data is given in random order and certain lines of data have been removed so you cannot reconstruct the original image from this dataset.  \n\n### Attribute information  \nThere are 36 predictive attributes (= 4 spectral bands x 9 pixels in neighborhood).\nIn each line of data the four spectral values for the top-left pixel are given first followed by the four spectral values for the top-middle pixel and then those for the top-right pixel, and so on with the pixels read out in sequence left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Thus, the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes 17,18,19 and 20. If you like you can use only these four attributes, while ignoring the others. This avoids the problem which arises when a 3x3 neighbourhood straddles a boundary. \n\nIn this version, the pixel values 0..255 are normalized around 0.\n\n**Note: it is unclear why the attributes are named Aattr - Fattr in this version, since there are only 4 bands and 9 pixels, naming them A1, B1, C1, D1, A2, B2, C2, D2, ... would have made more sense.**", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2014-04-23T13:14:59", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/3619/satimage.arff", "file_id": "3619", "default_target_attribute": "class", "version_label": "1", "tag": ["OpenML100", "study_1", "study_14", "study_34", "study_37", "study_41", "study_52", "study_7", "study_70", "study_76"], "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "72857195d1f6c4c2171c386594f870b2"}}, "26": {"data_set_description": {"id": "26", "name": "nursery", "version": "1", "description": "**Author**:   \n**Source**: Unknown -   \n**Please cite**:   \n\n1.

Relevant Information:\n \n  We create a digit database by collecting 250 samples from 44 writers.\n  The samples written by 30 writers are used for training,\n  cross-validation and writer dependent testing, and the digits \n  written by the other 14 are used for writer independent testing. This\n  database is also available in the UNIPEN format.\n \n  We use a WACOM PL-100V pressure sensitive tablet with an integrated \n  LCD display and a cordless stylus. The input and display areas are\n  located in the same place. Attached to the serial port of an Intel \n  486 based PC, it allows us to collect handwriting samples. The tablet\n  sends $x$ and $y$ tablet coordinates and pressure level values of the\n  pen at fixed time intervals (sampling rate) of 100 miliseconds. \n \n  These writers are asked to write 250 digits in random order inside \n  boxes of 500 by 500 tablet pixel resolution.  Subject are monitored \n  only during the first entry screens. Each screen contains five boxes\n  with the digits to be written displayed above. Subjects are told to\n  write only inside these boxes.  If they make a mistake or are unhappy\n  with their writing, they are instructed to clear the content of a box \n  by using an on-screen button. The first ten digits are ignored \n  because most writers are not familiar with this type of input devices,\n  but subjects are not aware of this. \n \n  In our study, we use only ($x, y$) coordinate information. The stylus\n  pressure level values are ignored. First we apply normalization to \n  make our representation invariant to translations and scale \n  distortions. The raw data that we capture from the tablet consist of\n  integer values between 0 and 500 (tablet input box resolution). The \n  new coordinates are such that the coordinate which has the maximum \n  range varies between 0 and 100. Usually $x$ stays in this range, since\n  most characters are taller than they are wide.  \n \n  In order to train and test our classifiers, we need to represent \n  digits as constant length feature vectors. A commonly used technique\n  leading to good results is resampling the ( x_t, y_t) points. \n  Temporal resampling (points regularly spaced in time) or spatial\n  resampling (points regularly spaced in arc length) can be used here. \n  Raw point data are already regularly spaced in time but the distance\n  between them is variable. Previous research showed that spatial\n  resampling to obtain a constant number of regularly spaced points \n  on the trajectory yields much better performance, because it provides \n  a better alignment between points. Our resampling algorithm uses \n  simple linear interpolation between pairs of points. The resampled\n  digits are represented as a sequence of T points ( x_t, y_t )_{t=1}^T,\n  regularly spaced in arc length, as opposed to the input sequence, \n  which is regularly spaced in time.\n \n  So, the input vector size is 2*T, two times the number of points\n  resampled. We considered spatial resampling to T=8,12,16 points in our\n  experiments and found that T=8 gave the best trade-off between \n  accuracy and complexity.\n \n \n 5.

Determination is found by measurement of height, diameter by height, survival, and other contributing factors. \n \nIt is important to note that eucalypt trial methods changed over time; earlier trials included mostly 15 - 30cm tall seedling grown in peat plots and the later trials have included mostly three replications of eight trees grown. This change may contribute to less significant results.\n\nExperimental data recording procedures which require noting include:\n - instances with no data recorded due to experimental recording procedures\n   require that the absence of a species from one replicate at a site was\n   treated as a missing value, but if absent from two or more replicates at a\n   site the species was excluded from the site's analyses.\n - missing data for survival, vigour, insect resistance, stem form, crown form\n   and utility especially for the data recorded at the Morea Station; this \n   could indicate the death of species in these areas or a lack in collection\n   of data.  \n\n### Attribute Information  \n \n  1.

The\n task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced\n off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.\n \n SOURCE: The data set was contributed to the benchmark collection by Terry\n Sejnowski, now at the Salk Institute and the University of California at\n San Deigo.  The data set was developed in collaboration with R. Paul\n Gorman of Allied-Signal Aerospace Technology Center.\n \n MAINTAINER: Scott E. Fahlman\n \n PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:\n \n The file \"sonar.mines\" contains 111 patterns obtained by bouncing sonar\n signals off a metal cylinder at various angles and under various\n conditions.  The file \"sonar.rocks\" contains 97 patterns obtained from\n rocks under similar conditions.  The transmitted sonar signal is a\n frequency-modulated chirp, rising in frequency.  The data set contains\n signals obtained from a variety of different aspect angles, spanning 90\n degrees for the cylinder and 180 degrees for the rock.\n \n Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0.  Each number\n represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over\n a certain period of time.  The integration aperture for higher frequencies\n occur later in time, since these frequencies are transmitted later during\n the chirp.\n \n The label associated with each record contains the letter \"R\" if the object\n is a rock and \"M\" if it is a mine (metal cylinder).  The numbers in the\n labels are in increasing order of aspect angle, but they do not encode the\n angle directly.\n \n METHODOLOGY: \n \n This data set can be used in a number of different ways to test learning\n speed, quality of ultimate learning, ability to generalize, or combinations\n of these factors.\n \n In [1], Gorman and Sejnowski report two series of experiments: an\n \"aspect-angle independent\" series, in which the whole data set is used\n without controlling for aspect angle, and an \"aspect-angle dependent\"\n series in which the training and testing sets were carefully controlled to\n ensure that each set contained cases from each aspect angle in\n appropriate proportions.\n \n For the aspect-angle independent experiments the combined set of 208 cases\n is divided randomly into 13 disjoint sets with 16 cases in each.  For each\n experiment, 12 of these sets are used as training data, while the 13th is\n reserved for testing.  The experiment is repeated 13 times so that every\n case appears once as part of a test set.  The reported performance is an\n average over the entire set of 13 different test sets, each run 10 times.\n \n It was observed that this random division of the sample set led to rather\n uneven performance.  A few of the splits gave poor results, presumably\n because the test set contains some samples from aspect angles that are\n under-represented in the corresponding training set.  This motivated Gorman\n and Sejnowski to devise a different set of experiments in which an attempt\n was made to balance the training and test sets so that each would have a\n representative number of samples from all aspect angles.  Since detailed\n aspect angle information was not present in the data base of samples, the\n 208 samples were first divided into clusters, using a 60-dimensional\n Euclidian metric; each of these clusters was then divided between the\n 104-member training set and the 104-member test set.  \n \n The actual training and testing samples used for the \"aspect angle\n dependent\" experiments are marked in the data files.  The reported\n performance is an average over 10 runs with this single division of the\n data set.\n \n A standard back-propagation network was used for all experiments.  The\n network had 60 inputs and 2 output units, one indicating a cylinder and the\n other a rock.  Experiments were run with no hidden units (direct\n connections from each input to each output) and with a single hidden layer\n with 2, 3, 6, 12, or 24 units.  Each network was trained by 300 epochs over\n the entire training set.\n \n The weight-update formulas used in this study were slightly different from\n the standard form.  A learning rate of 2.0 and momentum of 0.0 was used.\n Errors less than 0.2 were treated as zero.  Initial weights were uniform\n random values in the range -0.3 to +0.3.\n \n RESULTS: \n \n For the angle independent experiments, Gorman and Sejnowski report the\n following results for networks with different numbers of hidden units:\n \n Hidden\t% Right on\tStd.\t% Right on\tStd.\n Units\tTraining set\tDev.\tTest Set\tDev.\n ------\t------------\t----\t----------\t----\n 0\t89.4\t\t2.1\t77.1\t\t8.3\n 2\t96.5\t\t0.7\t81.9\t\t6.2\n 3\t98.8\t\t0.4\t82.0\t\t7.3\n 6\t99.7\t\t0.2\t83.5\t\t5.6\n 12\t99.8\t\t0.1\t84.7\t\t5.7\n 24\t99.8\t\t0.1\t84.5\t\t5.7\n \n For the angle-dependent experiments Gorman and Sejnowski report the\n following results:\n \n Hidden\t% Right on\tStd.\t% Right on\tStd.\n Units\tTraining set\tDev.\tTest Set\tDev.\n ------\t------------\t----\t----------\t----\n 0\t79.3\t\t3.4\t73.1\t\t4.8\n 2\t96.2\t\t2.2\t85.7\t\t6.3\n 3\t98.1\t\t1.5\t87.6\t\t3.0\n 6\t99.4\t\t0.9\t89.3\t\t2.4\n 12\t99.8\t\t0.6\t90.4\t\t1.8\n 24     100.0\t\t0.0\t89.2\t\t1.4\n \n Not surprisingly, the network's performance on the test set was somewhat\n better when the aspect angles in the training and test sets were balanced.\n \n Gorman and Sejnowski further report that a nearest neighbor classifier on\n the same data gave an 82.7% probability of correct classification.\n \n Three trained human subjects were each tested on 100 signals, chosen at\n random from the set of 208 returns used to create this data set.  Their\n responses ranged between 88% and 97% correct.  However, they may have been\n using information from the raw sonar signal that is not preserved in the\n processed data sets presented here.\n \n REFERENCES: \n \n 1. Gorman, R. P., and Sejnowski, T.

It was partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd.\n         The original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing\n         3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of\n         shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects.\n         Measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes\n         of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a class-\n         ification rule tree by means of computer induction.\n          This object recognition strategy was successfully used to \n         discriminate between silhouettes of model cars, vans and buses\n         viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation.\n          The rule tree classification performance compared favourably\n         to MDC (Minimum Distance Classifier) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neigh-\n         bour) statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and\n         computational efficiency. An investigation of these rule trees\n         generated by example indicated that the tree structure was \n         heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects, and grouped\n         similar object views into single decisions.\n \n DESCRIPTION\n          The features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS\n         (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which \n         extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising\n         both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance,\n         skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic\n         measures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and\n         compactness.\n          Four \"Corgie\" model vehicles were used for the experiment:\n         a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400.\n         This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the \n         expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would\n         be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to\n         distinguish between the cars.\n          The images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the\n         model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation (34.2 degrees\n         to the horizontal). The vehicles were placed on a diffuse\n         backlit surface (lightbox). The vehicles were painted matte black\n         to minimise highlights. The images were captured using a CRS4000\n         framestore connected to a vax 750. All images were captured with\n         a spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels quantised to 64 greylevels.\n         These images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes,\n         negated (to comply with the processing requirements of BINATTS) and\n         thereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink HIPS modules to\n         remove \"salt and pepper\" image noise.\n          The vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured\n         using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. 0 and 180 degrees\n         corresponded to \"head on\" and \"rear\" views respectively while 90 and\n         270 corresponded to profiles in opposite directions. Two sets of\n         60 images, each set covering a full 360 degree rotation, were captured\n         for each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between \n         images.

Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, 10, 262-266.\n\n      They investigated using backprop and the perceptron training algorithm\n      on this database.  Using the first 200 instances for training, which\n      were carefully split almost 50% positive and 50% negative, they found\n      that a \"linear\" perceptron attained 90.7%, a \"non-linear\" perceptron\n      attained 92%, and backprop an average of over 96% accuracy on the \n      remaining 150 test instances, consisting of 123 \"good\" and only 24 \"bad\"\n      instances.  (There was a counting error or some mistake somewhere; there\n      are a total of 351 rather than 350 instances in this domain.) Accuracy\n      on \"good\" instances was much higher than for \"bad\" instances.  Backprop\n      was tested with several different numbers of hidden units (in [0,15])\n      and incremental results were also reported (corresponding to how well\n      the different variants of backprop did after a periodic number of \n      epochs).\n\n      David Aha (aha@ics.uci.edu) briefly investigated this database.\n      He found that nearest neighbor attains an accuracy of 92.1%, that\n      Ross Quinlan's C4 algorithm attains 94.0% (no windowing), and that\n      IB3 (Aha & Kibler, IJCAI-1989) attained 96.7% (parameter settings:\n      70% and 80% for acceptance and dropping respectively).\n\n4. Relevant Information:\n   This radar data was collected by a system in Goose Bay, Labrador.  This\n   system consists of a phased array of 16 high-frequency antennas with a\n   total transmitted power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts.  See the paper\n   for more details.  The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere.\n   \"Good\" radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure \n   in the ionosphere.  \"Bad\" returns are those that do not; their signals pass\n   through the ionosphere.  \n\n   Received signals were processed using an autocorrelation function whose\n   arguments are the time of a pulse and the pulse number.  There were 17\n   pulse numbers for the Goose Bay system.  Instances in this databse are\n   described by 2 attributes per pulse number, corresponding to the complex\n   values returned by the function resulting from the complex electromagnetic\n   signal.\n\n5. Number of Instances: 351\n\n6. Number of Attributes: 34 plus the class attribute\n   -- All 34 predictor attributes are continuous\n\n7. Attribute Information:     \n   -- All 34 are continuous, as described above\n   -- The 35th attribute is either \"good\" or \"bad\" according to the definition\n      summarized above.  This is a binary classification task.\n\n8.

They are classified into: poisonous or edible.\n\n### Source\n```\n(a) Origin: \nMushroom records are drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). G. H. Lincoff (Pres.), New York: Alfred A. Knopf \n\n(b) Donor: \nJeff Schlimmer (Jeffrey.Schlimmer '@' a.gp.cs.cmu.edu)\n```\n\n### Dataset description\n\nThis dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family. Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ``leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.\n\n### Attributes Information\n```\n1. cap-shape: bell=b,conical=c,convex=x,flat=f, knobbed=k,sunken=s \n2. cap-surface: fibrous=f,grooves=g,scaly=y,smooth=s \n3. cap-color: brown=n,buff=b,cinnamon=c,gray=g,green=r, pink=p,purple=u,red=e,white=w,yellow=y \n4. bruises?: bruises=t,no=f \n5. odor: almond=a,anise=l,creosote=c,fishy=y,foul=f, musty=m,none=n,pungent=p,spicy=s \n6. gill-attachment: attached=a,descending=d,free=f,notched=n \n7. gill-spacing: close=c,crowded=w,distant=d \n8. gill-size: broad=b,narrow=n \n9. gill-color: black=k,brown=n,buff=b,chocolate=h,gray=g, green=r,orange=o,pink=p,purple=u,red=e, white=w,yellow=y \n10. stalk-shape: enlarging=e,tapering=t \n11. stalk-root: bulbous=b,club=c,cup=u,equal=e, rhizomorphs=z,rooted=r,missing=? \n12. stalk-surface-above-ring: fibrous=f,scaly=y,silky=k,smooth=s \n13. stalk-surface-below-ring: fibrous=f,scaly=y,silky=k,smooth=s \n14. stalk-color-above-ring: brown=n,buff=b,cinnamon=c,gray=g,orange=o, pink=p,red=e,white=w,yellow=y \n15. stalk-color-below-ring: brown=n,buff=b,cinnamon=c,gray=g,orange=o, pink=p,red=e,white=w,yellow=y \n16. veil-type: partial=p,universal=u \n17. veil-color: brown=n,orange=o,white=w,yellow=y \n18. ring-number: none=n,one=o,two=t \n19. ring-type: cobwebby=c,evanescent=e,flaring=f,large=l, none=n,pendant=p,sheathing=s,zone=z \n20. spore-print-color: black=k,brown=n,buff=b,chocolate=h,green=r, orange=o,purple=u,white=w,yellow=y \n21. population: abundant=a,clustered=c,numerous=n, scattered=s,several=v,solitary=y \n22. habitat: grasses=g,leaves=l,meadows=m,paths=p, urban=u,waste=w,woods=d\n```\n\n### Relevant papers\n\nSchlimmer,J.S.

The objective of the mission was to obtain global mapping of the surface of Venus using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). A more detailed discussion of the mission and objectives is available at JPL's Magellan webpage. \n\nThere are some spatial dependencies. For example, background patches from with in a single image are likely to be more similar than background patches taken across different images. \n\nIn addition to the images, there are \"ground truth\" files that specify the locations of volcanoes within the images. The quotes around \"ground truth\" are intended as a reminder that there is no absolute ground truth for this data set. No one has been to Venus and the image quality does not permit 100%, unambiguous identification of the volcanoes, even by human experts. There are labels that provide some measure of subjective uncertainty (1 = definitely a volcano, 2 = probably, 3 = possibly, 4 = only a pit is visible). See reference [Smyth95] for more information on the labeling uncertainty problem. \n\nThere are also files that specify the exact set of experiments using in the published evaluations of the JARtool system. \n\n* Attribute Information:\n\nThe images are 1024X1024 pixels. The pixel values are in the range [0,255]. The pixel value is related to the amount of energy backscattered to the radar from a given spatial location. Higher pixel values indicate greater backscatter. Lower pixel values indicate lesser backscatter. Both topography and surface roughness relative to the radar wavelength affect the amount of backscatter.\n\n\n* Relevant Papers:\n\nG.H. Pettengill, P.G. Ford, W.T.K. Johnson, R.K. Raney, L.A.

Harries and analyzed by J. Gama (see papers below). This data was collected from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market. In this market, prices are not fixed and are affected by demand and supply of the market. They are set every five minutes. Electricity transfers to/from the neighboring state of Victoria were done to alleviate fluctuations.\n\nThe dataset (originally named ELEC2) contains 45,312 instances dated from 7 May 1996 to 5 December 1998. Each example of the dataset refers to a period of 30 minutes, i.e. there are 48 instances for each time period of one day. Each example on the dataset has 5 fields, the day of week, the time stamp, the New South Wales electricity demand, the Victoria electricity demand, the scheduled electricity transfer between states and the class label. The class label identifies the change of the price (UP or DOWN) in New South Wales relative to a moving average of the last 24 hours (and removes the impact of longer term price trends). \n\nThe data was normalized by A. Bifet.\n\n### Attribute information  \n* Date: date between 7 May 1996 to 5 December 1998.

Relevant Information: (from John Stutz)\n The Infra-Red Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the first attempt to map the full sky at infra-red wavelengths.  This could not be done from ground observatories because large portions of the infra-red spectrum is absorbed by the atmosphere.  The primary observing program was the full high resolution sky mapping performed by scanning at 4 frequencies. The Low Resolution Observation (IRAS-LRS) program observed high intensity sources over two continuous spectral bands.  This database derives from a subset of the higher quality LRS observations taken between 12h and 24h right ascension. \nThis database contains 531 high quality spectra derived from the IRAS-LRS database.  The original data contained 100 spectral measurements in each of two overlapping bands.  Of these, 44 blue band and 49 red band channels contain usable flux measurements.  Only these are included here.  The original spectral intensities values are compressed to 4-digits, and each spectrum includes 5 rescaling parameters.  We have used the LRS specified algorithm to rescale these to units of spectral intensity (Janskys).  Total intensity differences have been eliminated by normalizing each spectrum to a mean value of 5000.\nThis database was originally obtained for use in development and testing of our AutoClass system for Bayesian classification.  We have not retained any results from this development, having concentrated our efforts of a 5425 element version of the same data.  Our classifications were based upon simultaneous modeling of all 93 spectral intensities. With the larger database we were able to find classes that correspond well with known spectral types associated with particular stellar types. We also found classes that match with the spectra expected of certain stellar processes under investigation by Ames astronomers.  These classes have considerably enlarged the set of stars being investigated by those researchers.  \n\nOriginal Data\nThe original fortran data file is given in spectra-2.data.

The task is to recognize promoters in strings that represent nucleotides (one of A, G, T, or C). A promoter is a genetic region which initiates the first step in the expression of an adjacent gene (transcription).  \n\nThe input features are 57 sequential DNA nucleotides. Fifty-three sample promoters and 53 nonpromoter sequences were used. The 53 sample promoters were obtained from a compilation\nproduced by Hawley and McClure (1983). Negative training examples were thus derived by selecting contiguous substrings from a 1.5 kilobase sequence provided by Prof. T. Record of the Univ. of Wisconsin\u2019s Chemistry Dept. This sequence is a fragment from E. coli bacteriophage T7 isolated with the restriction enzyme HaeIII. By virtue of the fact that the fragment does not bind RNA polymerase, it is believed to not contain any promoter sites.\n\nThis dataset has been developed to help evaluate a \"hybrid\" learning algorithm (\"KBANN\") that uses examples to inductively refine preexisting knowledge.\n\n### Attribute Description  \n\n* 1.

Number of Instances\n\n34,465 instances, mix of continuous and nominal, labeled by human expert.\n\nFirst 29,104 instances have been labeled with \"human prior\".\nSee the corresponding article described in section \"3. Past Usage\" for more details.\n\nNext 917 instances have been labeled using the active learning method called \"marg\".\nNext 964 instances refer to the active method called \"wmarg\".\nNext 995 instances refer to the active method called \"wmarg5\".\nNext 1,985 instances refer to the active method called \"rand\" (random selection).\n\nLast instances have been labeled during the corresponding challenge.\nMore details can be found in http://www.nomao.com/labs/challenge\nNext 163 instances refer to the active method called \"baseline\".\nNext 167 instances refer to the active method called \"nomao\".\nAnd last 170 instances refer to the active method called \"tsun\".\n\n5.2. Number of Attributes \n\n120 attributes: 89 continuous, 31 nominal (including the attributes 'label' and 'id'). \n\nThe features are separated by comma.\n\n5.3. Attribute Information: \n\nMissing data are allowed, represented by question marks '?'.\n\nLabels are +1 if the concerned spots must be merged, -1 if they do not refer to the same entity.\n\n1 id:

In fact this challenge faces any researcher in the field. However, although plenty of articles about predicting phishing websites have been disseminated these days, no reliable training dataset has been published publically, may be because there is no agreement in literature on the definitive features that characterize phishing webpages, hence it is difficult to shape a dataset that covers all possible features. \nIn this dataset, we shed light on the important features that have proved to be sound and effective in predicting phishing websites. In addition, we propose some new features.\n\n\nAttribute Information:\n\nFor Further information about the features see the features file in the [data folder](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00327/Phishing Websites Features.docx) of UCI.\n\nRelevant Papers:\n\nMohammad, Rami, McCluskey, T.L. and Thabtah, Fadi (2012) An Assessment of Features Related to Phishing Websites using an Automated Technique.

There are 38 control mice and 34 trisomic mice (Down syndrome), for a total of 72 mice. In the experiments, 15 measurements were registered of each protein per sample/mouse. Therefore, for control mice, there are 38x15, or 570 measurements, and for trisomic mice, there are 34x15, or 510 measurements. The dataset contains a total of 1080 measurements per protein. Each measurement can be considered as an independent sample/mouse. \n\nThe eight classes of mice are described based on features such as genotype, behavior and treatment. According to genotype, mice can be control or trisomic. According to behavior, some mice have been stimulated to learn (context-shock) and others have not (shock-context) and in order to assess the effect of the drug memantine in recovering the ability to learn in trisomic mice, some mice have been injected with the drug and others have not. \n\nClasses: \n```\n* c-CS-s: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) \n* c-CS-m: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (10 mice) \n* c-SC-s: control mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) \n* c-SC-m: control mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (10 mice) \n* t-CS-s: trisomy mice, stimulated to learn, injected with saline (7 mice) \n* t-CS-m: trisomy mice, stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (9 mice) \n* t-SC-s: trisomy mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) \n* t-SC-m: trisomy mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (9 mice) \n```\n\nThe aim is to identify subsets of proteins that are discriminant between the classes. \n\n### Attribute Information:\n\n```\n1 Mouse ID \n2..78 Values of expression levels of 77 proteins; the names of proteins are followed by &acirc;&euro;&oelig;_n&acirc;&euro;\u009d indicating that they were measured in the nuclear fraction.

Employees are manually allowed or denied access to resources over time. \nThe data is used to create an algorithm capable of learning from this historical data to predict approval/denial for an unseen set of employees.\n\n### Dataset Information\n\nWhen an employee at any company starts work, they first need to obtain the computer access necessary to fulfill their role. This access may allow an employee to read/manipulate resources through various applications or web portals. It is assumed that employees fulfilling the functions of a given role will access the same or similar resources. It is often the case that employees figure out the access they need as they encounter roadblocks during their daily work (e.g. not able to log into a reporting portal). A knowledgeable supervisor then takes time to manually grant the needed access in order to overcome access obstacles. As employees move throughout a company, this access discovery/recovery cycle wastes a non-trivial amount of time and money.\n\nThere is a considerable amount of data regarding an employee&rsquo;s role within an organization and the resources to which they have access. Given the data related to current employees and their provisioned access, models can be built that automatically determine access privileges as employees enter and leave roles within a company. These auto-access models seek to minimize the human involvement required to grant or revoke employee access.\n\nThe original training and test set were merged.\n\n### Attributes Information\n\n* ACTION [target]: ACTION is 1 if the resource was approved, 0 if the resource was not  \n* RESOURCE: An ID for each resource  \n* MGR_ID: The EMPLOYEE ID of the manager of the current EMPLOYEE ID record; an employee may have only one manager at a time  \n* ROLE_ROLLUP_1: Company role grouping category id 1 (e.g. US Engineering)  \n* ROLE_ROLLUP_2: Company role grouping category id 2 (e.g. US Retail)  \n* ROLE_DEPTNAME: Company role department description (e.g. Retail)  \n* ROLE_TITLE: Company role business title description (e.g. Senior Engineering Retail Manager)  \n* ROLE_FAMILY_DESC: Company role family extended description (e.g. Retail Manager, Software Engineering)  \n* ROLE_FAMILY: Company role family description (e.g. Retail Manager)  \n* ROLE_CODE: Company role code; this code is unique to each role (e.g. Manager)", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2015-11-05T00:06:06", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/1681098/Amazon_employee_access.arff", "file_id": "1681098", "default_target_attribute": "target", "tag": ["OpenML100", "study_14", "study_7"], "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "5502ee73e563ddf5b699ffe0c633905b"}}, "1121": {"data_set_description": {"id": "1121", "name": "badges2", "version": "1", "description": "**Author**:   \n**Source**: Unknown - Date unknown  \n**Please cite**:   \n\nDataset from the MLRR repository: http://axon.cs.byu.edu:5000/", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2014-10-07T00:42:03", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/54004/badges2.arff", "file_id": "54004", "default_target_attribute": "class", "row_id_attribute": "ID", "tag": ["mythbusting_1", "study_1", "study_15", "study_20", "study_52", "study_7", "study_88", "trivial"], "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "f10c6b6b7e7f582214073afe4f317b9f"}}, "1567": {"data_set_description": {"id": "1567", "name": "poker-hand", "version": "1", "description": "**Author**: Robert Cattral, Franz Oppacher    \n**Source**: UCI    \n**Please cite**:   \n\n* Abstract: \nPurpose is to predict poker hands\n\n* Source - Creators:   \nRobert Cattral (cattral '@' gmail.com)\nFranz Oppacher (oppacher '@' scs.carleton.ca) \nCarleton University, Department of Computer Science \nIntelligent Systems Research Unit \n1125 Colonel By Drive, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, K1S5B6\n\n\n* Data Set Information:\n\nEach record is an example of a hand consisting of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck of 52.

Such operations are routinely performed at intervals of\none to eight years depending upon the individual species growth rate\nand the amount of clearance required.  Ontario Hydro trims about\n500,000 trees per year at a cost of about $25 per tree.\n \nMuch effort has been spent in developing chemicals for the horticultural\nindustry to retard the growth of woody and herbaceous plants.  Recently,\na group of new growth regulators was introduced which was shown to be\neffective in controlling the growth of trees without producing\nnoticeable injury symptoms.  In this group are PP 333 ( common name\npaclobutrazol) (2RS, 3RS - 1 -(4-chlorophenyl) - 4,4 - dimethyl - 2 -\n(1,2,4-triazol-l-yl) pentan - 3- ol and EL-500 (common name flurprimidol\nand composition alpha - (1-methylethyl) - alpha - [4-(trifluromethoxyl)\nphenyl] - 5- pyrimidine - methanol).  Both EL-500 and PP-333 have been\nreported to control excessive sprout growth in a number of species\nwhen applied as a foliar spray, as a soil drench, or by trunk injection.\nSprout length is a function of both the number of internodes and\nthe length of the individual internodes in the sprout.  While there\nhave been many reports that both PP 333 and EL-500 cause a reduction\nin the length of internodes formed in sprouts on woody plants treated\nwith the growth regulators, there has been but one report that EL-500\napplication to apple trees resulted in a reduction of the number\nof internodes formed per sprout.\n \nThe purpose of the present study was to investigate the length of the\nterminal sprouts, the length of the individual internodes in those\nsprouts, and the number of internodes in trimmed silver maple trees\nfollowing trunk injection with the growth regulators PP 333 and EL-500.\n \nExperimental Details.\n \nMultistemmed 12-year-old silver maple trees growing at Wesleyville,\nOntario were trunk injected with methanolic solutions of EL-500\nand PP-333 in May of 1985 using a third generation Asplundh\ntree injector.\n \nTwo different application rates (20 g/L and 4 g/L) were used for each\nchemical.  The volume of solution (and hence the amount of active\ningredient) injected into each tree was determined from the diameter\nof the tree, using the formula: vol(mL) = (dbh)*(dbh)*.492 where dbh\nis the diameter at breast height.  Two sets of control trees were\nincluded in the experiment.  In one set, tree received no injection\n(control) and in a second set, the trees were injected with\nmethanol, the carrier in the growth regulator solutions.  Ten trees,\nchosen at random, were used in each of the control and experimental\nsets.  Prior to injection, all the trees were trimmed by a forestry\ncrew, with their heights being reduced by about one third.\n \nIn January 1987, twenty months after the trees were injected, between\nsix and eight limbs were removed at random from the bottom two-thirds\nof the canopy of each of the ten trees in each experimental and control\nset.  The limbs were returned to the laboratory and the length of all\nthe terminal sprouts, the lengths of the individual internodes, and\nthe number of internodes recorded.  Between one and 25 terminal\nsprouts were found on each limb collected.

A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. 21th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, ESANN 2013. Bruges, Belgium 24-26 April 2013.   \n\n**Human Activity Recognition**  \nHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. This dataset version contains all the training and testing examples provided in the original data repository.\n\nThe experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. \n\nThe sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low-frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.\n\n\n### Attribute Information  \nFor each record in the dataset it is provided: \n* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.  \n* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.  \n* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.  \n* It's activity label.  \n\n### Relevant Papers  \n\nDavide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L.

The aim is to reflect the nuances and heterogeneity of real data. Data can be generated in .csv, ARFF or C4.5 formats.\n\n* Source:  \n\nAutoUniv was developed by Ray. J. Hickey. Email: ray.j.hickey '@' gmail.com \nAutoUniv web-site: http://sites.google.com/site/autouniv/.\n\n\n* Data Set Information:\n\nThe user first creates a classification model and then generates classified examples from it. To create a model, the following are specified: the number of attributes (up to 1000) and their type (discrete or continuous), the number of classes (up to 10), the complexity of the underlying rules and the noise level. AutoUniv then produces a model through a process of constrained randomised search to satisfy the user's requirements. A model can have up to 3000 rules. Rare class models can be designed. A sequence of models can be designed to reflect concept and/or population drift. \n\nAutoUniv creates three text files for a model: a Prolog specification of the model used to generate examples (.aupl); a user-friendly statement of the classification rules in an 'if ... then' format (.aurules); a statistical summary of the main properties of the model, including its Bayes rate (.auprops).\n\n\n* Attribute Information: \n\nAttributes may be discrete with up to 10 values or continuous. A discrete attribute can be nominal with values v1, v2, v3 ... or integer with values 0, 1, 2 , ... .\n\n\n* Relevant Papers:\n\nMarrs, G, Hickey, RJ and Black, MM (2010) Modeling the example life-cycle in an online classification learner.

(2013) that involved detecting diseased trees in Quickbird imagery. There are few training samples for the 'diseased trees' class (74) and many for 'other land cover' class (4265). \n\nThe data set consists of image segments, generated by segmenting the pansharpened image. The segments contain spectral information from the Quickbird multispectral image bands and texture information from the panchromatic (Pan) image band. The testing data set is for the row with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Segmentation scale 15\u00e2\u20ac\u009d segments and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153original multi-spectral image\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Spectral information in Table 2 of the reference (i.e. row 5). Please see the reference below for more information on the data set, and please cite the reference if you use this data set. Enjoy! \n\n### Attribute Information:\n\nclass: 'w' (diseased trees), 'n' (all other land cover)   \nGLCM_Pan: GLCM mean texture (Pan band)   \nMean_G: Mean green value   \nMean_R: Mean red value   \nMean_NIR: Mean NIR value   \nSD_Pan: Standard deviation (Pan band)   \n\n\n### Relevant Papers:\n\nJohnson, B., Tateishi, R., Hoan, N., 2013.

The objective of the mission was to obtain global mapping of the surface of Venus using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). A more detailed discussion of the mission and objectives is available at JPL's Magellan webpage. \n\nThere are some spatial dependencies.

The quotes around \"ground truth\" are intended as a reminder that there is no absolute ground truth for this data set. No one has been to Venus and the image quality does not permit 100%, unambiguous identification of the volcanoes, even by human experts.

The pixel values are in the range [0,255]. The pixel value is related to the amount of energy backscattered to the radar from a given spatial location.

The data have been organized in two different but related classification tasks. The first task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one out of three categories: Normal (100 patients), Disk Hernia (60 patients) or Spondylolisthesis (150 patients). For the second task, the categories Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis were merged into a single category labelled as 'abnormal'. Thus, the second task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one out of two categories: Normal (100 patients) or Abnormal (210 patients). We provide files also for use within the WEKA environment.\n\n\nAttribute Information:\n\nEach patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine (in this order): pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius and grade of spondylolisthesis. The following convention is used for the class labels: DH (Disk Hernia), Spondylolisthesis (SL), Normal (NO) and Abnormal (AB).\n\n\n* Relevant Papers:\n\n(1) Berthonnaud, E., Dimnet, J., Roussouly, P. & Labelle, H.

The data have been organized in two different but related classification tasks. The first task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one out of three categories: Normal (100 patients), Disk Hernia (60 patients) or Spondylolisthesis (150 patients). For the second task, the categories Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis were merged into a single category labelled as 'abnormal'. Thus, the second task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one out of two categories: Normal (100 patients) or Abnormal (210 patients). We provide files also for use within the WEKA environment.\n\n\n* Attribute Information:\n\nEach patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine (in this order): pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius and grade of spondylolisthesis. The following convention is used for the class labels: DH (Disk Hernia), Spondylolisthesis (SL), Normal (NO) and Abnormal (AB).\n\n\n* Relevant Papers:\n\n(1) Berthonnaud, E., Dimnet, J., Roussouly, P. & Labelle, H.

Sensor readings are sampled at a rate of 9 samples per second. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the 24 ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step, so each file has the same number of rows (one for each sampling time step). \n\nThe wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a non-linearly separable classification task. Thus, linear classifiers, such as the Perceptron network, are not able to learn the task and command the robot around the room without collisions. Nonlinear neural classifiers, such as the MLP network, are able to learn the task and command the robot successfully without collisions. \n\nIf some kind of short-term memory mechanism is provided to the neural classifiers, their performances are improved in general. For example, if past inputs are provided together with current sensor readings, even the Perceptron becomes able to learn the task and command the robot successfully. If a recurrent neural network, such as the Elman network, is used to learn the task, the resulting dynamical classifier is able to learn the task using less hidden neurons than the MLP network. \n\n* Attribute Information:\n\nNumber of Attributes: sensor_readings_2.data: 2 numeric attributes and the class. \n\nFor Each Attribute: \n-- File sensor_readings_2.data: \n1.

In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to \nthis date. The \"goal\" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0). \n\nThe names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values. \n\nOne file has been \"processed\", that one containing the Cleveland database.

Five different attributes were chosen to characterize each vowel: they are the amplitudes of the five first harmonics AHi, normalised by the total energy Ene (integrated on all the frequencies): AHi/Ene. The phonemes are transcribed as follows: sh as in she, dcl as in dark, iy as the vowel in she, aa as the vowel in dark, and ao as the first vowel in water.  \n\n### Source\n\nThe current dataset was formatted by the KEEL repository, but originally hosted by the [ELENA Project](https://www.elen.ucl.ac.be/neural-nets/Research/Projects/ELENA/elena.htm#stuff). The dataset originates from the European ESPRIT 5516 project: ROARS. The aim of this project was the development and the implementation of a real time analytical system for French and Spanish speech recognition.  \n\n### Relevant information\n\nMost of the already existing speech recognition systems are global systems (typically Hidden Markov Models and Time Delay Neural Networks) which recognizes signals and do not really use the speech\nspecificities.  On the contrary, analytical systems take into account the articulatory process leading to the different phonemes of a given language, the idea being to deduce the presence of each of the\nphonetic features from the acoustic observation.\n\nThe main difficulty of analytical systems is to obtain acoustical parameters sufficiantly reliable. These acoustical measurements must :\n\n   - contain all the information relative to the concerned phonetic feature.\n   - being speaker independent.\n   - being context independent.\n   - being more or less robust to noise.\n\nThe primary acoustical observation is always voluminous (spectrum x N different observation moments) and classification cannot been processed directly.\n\nIn ROARS, the initial database is provided by cochlear spectra, which may be seen as the output of a filters bank having a constant DeltaF/F0, where the central frequencies are distributed on a\nlogarithmic scale (MEL type) to simulate the frequency answer of the auditory nerves.  The filters outputs are taken every 2 or 8 msec (integration on 4 or 16 msec) depending on the type of phoneme\nobserved (stationary or transitory).  \n\nThe aim of the present database is to distinguish between nasal and\noral vowels. There are thus two different classes:\n\n- Class 0 : Nasals  \n- Class 1 : Orals        \n\nThis database contains vowels coming from 1809 isolated syllables (for example: pa, ta, pan,...). Five different attributes were chosen to characterize each vowel: they are the amplitudes of the five first harmonics AHi, normalised by the total energy Ene (integrated on all the frequencies): AHi/Ene. Each harmonic is signed: positive when it corresponds to a local maximum of the spectrum and negative otherwise.\n\nThree observation moments have been kept for each vowel to obtain 5427 different instances: \n\n - the observation corresponding to the maximum total energy Ene. \n   \n - the observations taken 8 msec before and 8 msec after the observation corresponding to this maximum total energy.\n\nFrom these 5427 initial values, 23 instances for which the amplitude of the 5 first harmonics was zero were removed, leading to the 5404 instances of the present database. The patterns are presented in a random order.\n\n### Past Usage  \n\nAlinat, P., Periodic Progress Report 4, ROARS Project ESPRIT II- Number 5516, February 1993, Thomson report TS.

Most activity related EEG patterns occur within the following frequency bands. Delta (0.5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 4 Hz.), Theta (4 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 8 Hz), Alpha (8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 13 Hz), Beta (13 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 22 Hz), and Gamma (30 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 40 Hz). The waves with the frequency of 7 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 13 Hz over motor processing areas are called mu rhythm and reflect idling activity in motor areas. It is more pronounced when the subjects are at rest and at least a second before subjects initiate voluntary movement, the mu activity over the hemisphere contralateral to the region moved shows a decrease in amplitude and is called Event Related Desynchronization (ERD). \nFor the current study, EEG data was collected for 5 times on various days from a healthy right-handed subject of 25 years of age. The data was recorded on a Medelec Profile Digital EEG machine. The settings of high frequency filter 50 Hz, low frequency filter 1.6 Hz, notch filter 50 Hz, sensitivity 70 micro volts/mm, and a sampling rate of 256 Hz were used for the basic signal processing. \nEight EEG electrodes (C3, C4, P3, P4, F3, F4, T3, and T4) were placed according to the international standard 10-20 system of electrode placement. Bipolar and unipolar EEG was recorded from eight Ag/AgCI scalp electrodes, which were placed 2.5 cm anterior and posterior to the central electrodes C3 and C4 (left and right side of the hemisphere). A1 and A2 are reference electrodes. The reference electrodes are placed on the left and right ears and the ground electrode on the forehead. EOG (Electrooculogram) being a noise artifact, was derived from two electrodes, placed on the outer cantus of left and right eye in order to detect eye movement. These EOG signals are then used to eliminate eye movement artifacts. \nThe subject was asked to lie down comfortably in a relaxed position with eyes closed and advised to minimize eye movements. The EEG was recorded for the relaxed state for 5 minutes. Following this, an audio beep of 60 db and 0.91 sec. duration was given at the start and end of a 5 second epoch where the subject was asked to mentally plan lifting of the right hand thumb. This activity is collected as a 5 second epoch data corresponding to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmovement imagery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 state. After a gap of 5 minutes, the same cue is given to repeat the experiment. The whole experiment lasts for approximately 30 minutes, collecting data for 5 trials of 5 second epoch each for normal relaxed state and 5 trials of 5 second epoch each for movement imagery. No actual movement is performed during the session. All data sets were visually checked for artifacts before final selection.\n\n\n* Attribute Information:\n\nWavelet transform has been applied for feature extraction for EEG classification. However, wavelet transforms pyramidal algorithm work only on approximation coefficients. So it can not identify 7-13 Hz frequency band. We have extended the methodology by applying wavelet packet analysis, which also decompose detail coefficients. Wavelet packet analysis has been used for signal decomposition with equal frequency bandwidth at each level of decomposition, which leads to an equal number of the approximation and detail coefficients. By applying wavelet packet analysis on the original signal, we have obtained twelve wavelet coefficients in the 7-13 Hz frequency band at the 6th level node (6,2).

Sensor readings are sampled at a rate of 9 samples per second.\n\nThe class labels are:  \n1. Move-Forward,  \n2. Slight-Right-Turn,  \n3. Sharp-Right-Turn,  \n4. Slight-Left-Turn  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the 24 ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step, so each file has the same number of rows (one for each sampling time step). \n\nThe wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a non-linearly separable classification task. Thus, linear classifiers, such as the Perceptron network, are not able to learn the task and command the robot around the room without collisions. Nonlinear neural classifiers, such as the MLP network, are able to learn the task and command the robot successfully without collisions. \n\n### Attribute Information:\n\n1.

High quality visualization of the internal kernel structure was detected using a soft X-ray technique. It is non-destructive and considerably cheaper than other more sophisticated imaging techniques like scanning microscopy or laser technology. The images were recorded on 13x18 cm X-ray KODAK plates. Studies were conducted using combine harvested wheat grain originating from experimental fields, explored at the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lublin. The data set can be used for the tasks of classification and cluster analysis.\n\n* Attribute Information:\n\nTo construct the data, seven geometric parameters of wheat kernels were measured: \n1. area A, \n2. perimeter P, \n3. compactness C = 4*pi*A/P^2, \n4. length of kernel, \n5. width of kernel, \n6. asymmetry coefficient \n7. length of kernel groove. \nAll of these parameters were real-valued continuous.\n\n\n* Relevant Papers:\n\nM.

Fahlman, CMU\n\n### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:\n\n__A very comprehensive description including comments by the authors can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/undocumented/connectionist-bench/vowel/vowel.names)\n\nThe problem is specified by the accompanying data file, \"vowel.data\".  This\nconsists of a three dimensional array: voweldata [speaker, vowel, input].\nThe speakers are indexed by integers 0-89.  (Actually, there are fifteen\nindividual speakers, each saying each vowel six times.)  The vowels are\nindexed by integers 0-10.  For each utterance, there are ten floating-point\ninput values, with array indices 0-9.\n\nThe problem is to train the network as well as possible using only on data\nfrom \"speakers\" 0-47, and then to test the network on speakers 48-89,\nreporting the number of correct classifications in the test set.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of the problem, see the excerpt from Tony\nRobinson's Ph.D. thesis in the COMMENTS section.  In Robinson's opinion,\nconnectionist problems fall into two classes, the possible and the\nimpossible.  He is interested in the latter, by which he means problems\nthat have no exact solution.  Thus the problem here is not to see how fast\na network can be trained (although this is important), but to maximise a\nless than perfect performance.\n\n#### METHODOLOGY:\n\nReport the number of test vowels classified correctly, (i.e. the number of\noccurences when distance of the correct output to the actual output was the\nsmallest of the set of distances from the actual output to all possible\ntarget outputs).\n\nThough this is not the focus of Robinson's study, it would also be useful\nto report how long the training took (measured in pattern presentations or\nwith a rough count of floating-point operations required) and what level of\nsuccess was achieved on the training and testing data after various amounts\nof training.  Of course, the network topology and algorithm used should be\nprecisely described as well.\n\n#### VARIATIONS:\n\nThis benchmark is proposed to encourage the exploration of different node\ntypes.  Please theorise/experiment/hack.  The author (Robinson) will try to\ncorrespond by email if requested.  In particular there has been some\ndiscussion recently on the use of a cross-entropy distance measure, and it\nwould be interesting to see results for that.\n\n#### RESULTS:\n\nA more complete explanation of this data is given in the excerpt from his thesis in the\nCOMMENTS section below. The program used to obtain these results is in the\ncode directory, /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project as \"vowel.c\".\n\n\n#### Notes: \n\n1. Each of these numbers is based on a single trial with random starting\nweights.  More trials would of course be preferable, but the computational\nfacilities available to Robinson were limited.\n\n2. Graphs are given in Robinson's thesis showing test-set performance vs.\nepoch count for some of the training runs.  In most cases, performance\npeaks at around 250 correct, after which performance decays to different\ndegrees.  The numbers given above are final performance figures after about\n3000 trials, not the peak performance obtained during the run.\n\n#### REFERENCES:\n\n[Deterding89] D. H.

A special case of such threat is a seismic hazard which frequently occurs in many underground mines. Seismic hazard is the hardest detectable and predictable of natural hazards and in this respect it is comparable to an earthquake. More and more advanced seismic and seismoacoustic monitoring systems allow a better understanding rock mass processes and definition of seismic hazard \nprediction methods. Accuracy of so far created methods is however far from perfect. Complexity of seismic processes and big disproportion between the number of low-energy seismic events and the number of high-energy phenomena (e.g. > 10^4J) causes the statistical techniques to be insufficient to predict seismic hazard. Therefore, it is essential to search for new opportunities of better hazard prediction, also using machine learning methods. In seismic hazard assessment data clustering techniques can be \napplied (Lesniak A., Isakow Z.: Space-time clustering of seismic events and hazard assessment in the Zabrze-Bielszowice coal mine, Poland. Int. Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 46(5), 2009, 918-928), and for prediction of seismic tremors artificial neural networks are used (Kabiesz, J.: Effect of the form of data on the quality of mine tremors hazard forecasting using neural networks. Geotechnical and Geological Engineering, 24(5), 2005, 1131-1147). In the majority of applications, the results obtained by mentioned methods are reported in the form of two states which are interpreted as 'hazardous' and 'non-hazardous'. Unbalanced distribution of positive ('hazardous state') and negative ('non-hazardous state') examples is a serious problem in seismic hazard prediction. Currently used methods are still insufficient to achieve good sensitivity and specificity of predictions. In the paper \n(Bukowska M.: The probability of rockburst occurrence in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin area dependent on natural mining conditions. Journal of Mining Sciences, 42(6), 2006, 570-577) a number of factors having an effect on seismic hazard occurrence was proposed, among other factors, the occurrence of tremors with energy > 10^4J was listed. The task of seismic prediction can be defined in different ways, but the main aim of all seismic hazard assessment methods is to predict (with given precision relating to time and \ndate) of increased seismic activity which can cause a rockburst. In the data set each row contains a summary statement about seismic activity in the rock mass within one shift (8 hours). If decision attribute has the value 1, then in the next shift any seismic bump with an energy higher than 10^4 J was registered. That task of hazards prediction bases on the relationship between the energy of recorded tremors and seismoacoustic activity with the possibility of rockburst occurrence. Hence, such hazard prognosis is not connected with accurate rockburst prediction. Moreover, with the information about the possibility of hazardous situation occurrence, an appropriate supervision service can reduce a risk of rockburst (e.g. by distressing shooting) or withdraw workers from the threatened area. Good prediction of increased seismic activity is therefore a matter of great practical importance. The presented data set is characterized by unbalanced distribution of positive and negative examples. In the data set there \nare only 170 positive examples representing class 1. \n\n\n* Attribute Information:\n\n1. seismic: result of shift seismic hazard assessment in the mine working obtained by the seismic \nmethod (a - lack of hazard, b - low hazard, c - high hazard, d - danger state); \n2. seismoacoustic: result of shift seismic hazard assessment in the mine working obtained by the \nseismoacoustic method; \n3. shift: information about type of a shift (W - coal-getting, N -preparation shift); \n4. genergy: seismic energy recorded within previous shift by the most active geophone (GMax) out of \ngeophones monitoring the longwall; \n5. gpuls: a number of pulses recorded within previous shift by GMax; \n6. gdenergy: a deviation of energy recorded within previous shift by GMax from average energy recorded \nduring eight previous shifts; \n7. gdpuls: a deviation of a number of pulses recorded within previous shift by GMax from average number \nof pulses recorded during eight previous shifts; \n8. ghazard: result of shift seismic hazard assessment in the mine working obtained by the \nseismoacoustic method based on registration coming form GMax only; \n9. nbumps: the number of seismic bumps recorded within previous shift; \n10. nbumps2: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^2,10^3)) registered within previous shift; \n11. nbumps3: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^3,10^4)) registered within previous shift; \n12. nbumps4: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^4,10^5)) registered within previous shift; \n13. nbumps5: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^5,10^6)) registered within the last shift; \n14. nbumps6: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^6,10^7)) registered within previous shift; \n15. nbumps7: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^7,10^8)) registered within previous shift; \n16. nbumps89: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^8,10^10)) registered within previous shift; \n17. energy: total energy of seismic bumps registered within previous shift; \n18. maxenergy: the maximum energy of the seismic bumps registered within previous shift; \n19. class: the decision attribute - '1' means that high energy seismic bump occurred in the next shift \n('hazardous state'), '0' means that no high energy seismic bumps occurred in the next shift \n('non-hazardous state').", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2015-05-25T22:11:21", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/1592292/seismic-bumps.arff", "file_id": "1592292", "default_target_attribute": "Class", "tag": ["study_7", "study_88"], "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "e997c7fed8ca4ba9333e89b25ba8f695"}}, "38": {"data_set_description": {"id": "38", "name": "sick", "version": "1", "description": "**Author**: Ross Quinlan\n**Source**: [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/thyroid+disease)   \n**Please cite**: Thyroid disease records supplied by the Garavan Institute and J.

Past Usage:\n\nThis database has a private usage at the TIRF laboratory. It has been created in order to study the textures discrimination with high order statistics.\n\n```\nA.Guerin-Dugue, C. Aviles-Cruz, \"High Order Statistics from Natural Textured Images\",\nIn ATHOS workshop on System Identification and High Order Statistics, Sophia-Antipolis, France, September 1993.\n\nGuerin-Dugue, A. and others, Deliverable R3-B4-P - Task B4: Benchmarks, Technical report,\nElena-NervesII \"Enhanced Learning for Evolutive Neural Architecture\", ESPRIT-Basic Research Project  Number 6891,\nJune 1995.\n```\n\n####3. Relevant Information:\n\nThe aim is to distinguish between 11 different textures (Grass lawn, Pressed calf leather, Handmade paper, Raffia looped to a high pile, Cotton canvas, ...), each pattern (pixel) being characterised by 40 attributes built by the estimation of fourth order modified moments in four orientations: 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees.\n\nA statistical method based on the extraction of fourth order moments for the characterization of natural micro-textures was developed called \"fourth order modified moments\" (mm4) [Guerin93], this method measures the deviation from first-order Gauss-Markov process, for each texture. The features were estimated in four directions to take into account the possible orientations of the textures (0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees). Only correlation between the current pixel, the first neighbourhood and the second neighbourhood are taken into account. This small neighbourhood is adapted to the fine grain property of the textures.\n\nThe data set contains 11 classes of 500 instances and each class refers to a type of texture in the Brodatz album.\n\nThe database dimension is 40 plus one for the class label. The 40 attributes were build respectively by the estimation of the following fourth order modified moments in four orientations: 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees: mm4(000), mm4(001), mm4(002), mm4(011), mm4(012), mm4(022), mm4(111), mm4(112), mm4(122) and mm4(222).\n\n!! Patterns are always sorted by class and are presented in the increasing order of their class label in each dataset relative to the texture database (texture.dat, texture_CR.dat, texture_PCA.dat, texture_DFA.dat)\n\n####4. Class:\n\nThe class label is a code for the following classes:\n```\n                Class         Class label\n  2   Grass lawn                      (D09)  \n  3   Pressed calf leather            (D24) \n  4   Handmade paper                  (D57) \n  6   Raffia looped to a high pile:   (D84) \n  7   Cotton canvas                   (D77) \n  8   Pigskin                         (D92) \n  9   Beach sand:                     (D28) \n  10  Beach sand                      (D29) \n  12  Oriental straw cloth            (D53) \n  13  Oriental straw cloth            (D78) \n  14  Oriental grass fiber cloth      (D79) \n```\n\n####5.

Result of the Principal Component Analysis:\n\nThe Principal Components Analysis is a very classical method in pattern recognition [Duda73]. PCA reduces the sample dimension in a linear way for the best representation in lower dimensions keeping the maximum of inertia. The best axe for the representation is however not necessary the best axe for the discrimination. After PCA, features are selected according to the percentage of initial inertia which is covered by the different axes and the number of features is determined according to the percentage of initial inertia to keep for the classification process.\n\nThis selection method has been applied on the texture_CR database. When quasi-linear correlations exists between some initial features, these redundant dimensions are removed by PCA and this preprocessing is then recommended. In this case, before a PCA, the determinant of the data covariance matrix is near zero; this database is thus badly conditioned for all process which use this information (the quadratic classifier for example).\n\nThe following file is available for the texture database: ''texture_PCA.dat.Z'', it is the projection of the ''texture_CR'' database on its principal components (sorted in a decreasing order of the related inertia percentage; so, if you desire to work on the database projected on its x first principal components you only have to keep the x first attributes of the texture_PCA.dat database and the class labels (last attribute)).\n\nTable here below provides the inertia percentages associated to the eigenvalues corresponding to the principal component axis sorted in the decreasing order of the associated inertia percentage. 99.85 percent of the total database inertia will remain if the 20 first principal components are kept.\n\n```\n       Eigen Value   Inertia      Cumulated\n         value      percentage      inertia\n\n  1   30.267500000 75.6687000000  75.6687000000 \n  2   3.6512500000  9.1281300000  84.7969000000 \n  3   2.2937000000  5.7342400000  90.5311000000 \n  4   1.7039700000  4.2599300000  94.7910000000 \n  5   0.6716540000  1.6791300000  96.4702000000 \n  6   0.5015290000  1.2538200000  97.7240000000 \n  7   0.1922830000  0.4807070000  98.2047000000 \n  8   0.1561070000  0.3902670000  98.5950000000 \n  9   0.1099570000  0.2748920000  98.8699000000 \n  10  0.0890891000  0.2227230000  99.0926000000 \n  11  0.0656016000  0.1640040000  99.2566000000 \n  12  0.0489988000  0.1224970000  99.3791000000 \n  13  0.0433819000  0.1084550000  99.4875000000 \n  14  0.0345022000  0.0862554000  99.5738000000 \n  15  0.0299203000  0.0748007000  99.6486000000 \n  16  0.0248857000  0.0622141000  99.7108000000 \n  17  0.0167901000  0.0419752000  99.7528000000 \n  18  0.0161633000  0.0404083000  99.7932000000 \n  19  0.0128898000  0.0322246000  99.8254000000 \n  20  0.0113884000  0.0284710000  99.8539000000 \n  21  0.0078481400  0.0196204000  99.8735000000 \n  22  0.0071527800  0.0178820000  99.8914000000 \n  23  0.0067661400  0.0169153000  99.9083000000 \n  24  0.0053149500  0.0132874000  99.9216000000 \n  25  0.0051102600  0.0127757000  99.9344000000 \n  26  0.0047116600  0.0117792000  99.9461000000 \n  27  0.0036193700  0.0090484300  99.9552000000 \n  28  0.0033222000  0.0083054900  99.9635000000 \n  29  0.0030722400  0.0076806100  99.9712000000 \n  30  0.0026373300  0.0065933300  99.9778000000 \n  31  0.0020996800  0.0052492000  99.9830000000 \n  32  0.0019376500  0.0048441200  99.9879000000 \n  33  0.0015642300  0.0039105700  99.9918000000 \n  34  0.0009679080  0.0024197700  99.9942000000 \n  35  0.0009578000  0.0023945000  99.9966000000 \n  36  0.0007379780  0.0018449400  99.9984000000 \n  37  0.0006280250  0.0015700600  100.000000000\n  38  0.0000000040  0.0000000099  100.000000000 \n  39  0.0000000001  0.0000000003  100.000000000 \n  40  0.0000000008  0.0000000019  100.000000000 \n\n```\n\nThis matrix can be found in the texture_EV.dat file.\n\nThe Discriminant Factorial Analysis (DFA) can be applied to a learning database where each learning sample belongs to a particular class [Duda73]. The number of discriminant features selected by DFA is fixed in function of the number of classes (c) and of the number of input dimensions (d); this number is equal to the minimum between d and c-1. In the usual case where d is greater than c, the output dimension is fixed equal to the number of classes minus one and the discriminant axes are selected in order to maximize the between-variance and to minimize the within-variance of the classes.\n\nThe discrimination power (ratio of the projected between-variance over the projected within-variance) is not the same for each discriminant axis: this ratio decreases for each axis. So for a problem with many classes, this preprocessing will not be always efficient as the last output features will not be so discriminant. This analysis uses the information of the inverse of the global covariance matrix, so the covariance matrix must be well conditioned (for example, a preliminary PCA must be applied to remove the linearly correlated dimensions).\n\nThe Discriminant Factorial Analysis (DFA) has been applied on the 18 first principal components of the texture_PCA database (thus by keeping only the 18 first attributes of these databases before to apply the DFA preprocessing) in order to build the texture_DFA.dat.Z database file, having 10 dimensions (the texture database having 11 classes). In the case of the texture database, experiments shown that a DFA preprocessing is very useful and most of the time improved the classifiers performances.\n\n[Duda73] Duda, R.O. and Hart, P.E.,Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis, John Wiley & Sons, 1973.", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2016-07-29T21:03:14", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/4535764/texture.arff", "file_id": "4535764", "default_target_attribute": "Class", "version_label": "1", "tag": ["OpenML100", "study_14", "study_50", "study_52"], "visibility": "public", "original_data_url": "http://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/dataset.php?cod=72", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "47abf0594dbe574a3b04347e89e88a7a"}}, "40509": {"data_set_description": {"id": "40509", "name": "Australian", "version": "3", "description": "**Author**: Confidential.

The five dimensions constitute 5 informative features. 15 linear combinations of those features were added to form a set of 20 (redundant) informative features. Based on those 20 features one must separate the examples into the 2 classes (corresponding to the +-1 labels). It was added a number of distractor feature called 'probes' having no predictive power. The order of the features and patterns were randomized. \n\nThis dataset is one of five datasets used in the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge. The original data was split into training, validation and test set. Target values are provided only for two first sets (not for the test set). So, this dataset version contains all the examples from training and validation partitions. \n\nThere is no attribute information provided to avoid biasing the feature selection process.\n\n#### Relevant Papers:\n\nThe best challenge entrants wrote papers collected in the book: \nIsabelle Guyon, Steve Gunn, Masoud Nikravesh, Lofti Zadeh (Eds.), Feature Extraction, Foundations and Applications.

The dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.\n\nThe dataset was gathered within January 2007 to February 2011 (36 months) in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. \n\nBeing completely operated by a fully computerized environment controlled by a LabVIEW's National Instruments software on a PC fitted with the appropriate serial data acquisition boards. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner, minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors for compensating real drift.\n\nThe resulting dataset comprises recordings from six distinct pure gaseous substances, namely Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Ethylene, Ethanol, and Toluene, each dosed at a wide variety of concentration values ranging from 5 to 1000 ppmv. An extension of this dataset with the concentration values is available at [Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset at Different Concentrations Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+Sensor+Array+Drift+Dataset+at+Different+Concentrations).\n\n\n### Attribute Information\n\nThe response of the said sensors is read-out in the form of the resistance across the active layer of each sensor. Hence each measurement produced a 16-channel time series, each of which represented by an aggregate of features reflecting all the dynamic processes occurring at the sensor surface in reaction to the chemical substance being evaluated. \n\nIn particular, two distinct types of features were considered in the creation of this dataset: \n(i) The so-called steady-state feature (\u00ce\u201dR), defined as the difference of the maximal resistance change and the baseline and its normalized version expressed by the ratio of the maximal resistance and the baseline values when the chemical vapor is present in the test chamber; and \n(ii) an aggregate of features reflecting the sensor dynamics of the increasing/decaying transient portion of the sensor response during the entire measurement procedure under controlled conditions, namely the exponential moving average (ema\u00ce\u00b1). These aggregate of features is a transform, borrowed from the field of econometrics originally introduced to the chemo-sensing community by Muezzinoglu et al. (2009), that converts the said transient portion into a real scalar, by estimating the maximum value \u00e2\u20ac\u201dminimum for the decaying portion of the sensor response\u00e2\u20ac\u201d of its exponential moving average (ema\u00ce\u00b1), with an initial condition set to zero and a scalar smoothing parameter of the operator, \u00ce\u00b1, that defines both the quality of the feature and the time of its occurrence along the time series the scalar, set to range between 0 and 1. In particular, three different values for \u00ce\u00b1 were set to obtain three different feature values from the pre-recorded rising portion of the sensor response and three additional features with the same \u00ce\u00b1 values but for the decaying portion of the sensor response, covering thus the entire sensor response dynamics. \n\nFor a more detailed analysis and discussion on these features as well as a graphical illustration of them please refer to Section 2.3 and Figure 2, respectively of the annotated manuscript.\n\nOnce the abovementioned features are calculated, one is to form a feature vector containing the 8 features extracted from each particular sensor multiplied by the 16 sensors considered here.

The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between ``bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and \"good\" normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.\nThe training and test datasets are also available in the UC Irvine KDD archive.\n\n\n\n\nKDD Cup 1999: Tasks\n\nThis document is adapted from the paper Cost-based Modeling and Evaluation for Data Mining With Application to Fraud and Intrusion Detection: Results from the JAM Project by Salvatore J. Stolfo, Wei Fan, Wenke Lee, Andreas Prodromidis, and Philip K. Chan.\n\nIntrusion Detector Learning\n\nSoftware to detect network intrusions protects a computer network from unauthorized users, including perhaps insiders. The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between ``bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and ``good'' normal connections.\n\nThe 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program was prepared and managed by MIT Lincoln Labs. The objective was to survey and evaluate research in intrusion detection. A standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment, was provided. The 1999 KDD intrusion detection contest uses a version of this dataset.\n\nLincoln Labs set up an environment to acquire nine weeks of raw TCP dump data for a local-area network (LAN) simulating a typical U.S. Air Force LAN. They operated the LAN as if it were a true Air Force environment, but peppered it with multiple attacks.\n\nThe raw training data was about four gigabytes of compressed binary TCP dump data from seven weeks of network traffic. This was processed into about five million connection records. Similarly, the two weeks of test data yielded around two million connection records.\n\nA connection is a sequence of TCP packets starting and ending at some well defined times, between which data flows to and from a source IP address to a target IP address under some well defined protocol. Each connection is labeled as either normal, or as an attack, with exactly one specific attack type. Each connection record consists of about 100 bytes.\n\nAttacks fall into four main categories:\n\n* DOS: denial-of-service, e.g. syn flood;\n* R2L: unauthorized access from a remote machine, e.g. guessing password;\n* U2R: unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges, e.g., various ``buffer overflow'' attacks;\n* probing: surveillance and other probing, e.g., port scanning.\n\nIt is important to note that the test data is not from the same probability distribution as the training data, and it includes specific attack types not in the training data. This makes the task more realistic. Some intrusion experts believe that most novel attacks are variants of known attacks and the \"signature\" of known attacks can be sufficient to catch novel variants. The datasets contain a total of 24 training attack types, with an additional 14 types in the test data only.\n\nDerived Features\n\nStolfo et al. defined higher-level features that help in distinguishing normal connections from attacks. There are several categories of derived features.\n\nThe ``same host'' features examine only the connections in the past two seconds that have the same destination host as the current connection, and calculate statistics related to protocol behavior, service, etc.\n\nThe similar ``same service'' features examine only the connections in the past two seconds that have the same service as the current connection.\n\n\"Same host\" and \"same service\" features are together called time-based traffic features of the connection records.\n\nSome probing attacks scan the hosts (or ports) using a much larger time interval than two seconds, for example once per minute. Therefore, connection records were also sorted by destination host, and features were constructed using a window of 100 connections to the same host instead of a time window. This yields a set of so-called host-based traffic features.\n\nUnlike most of the DOS and probing attacks, there appear to be no sequential patterns that are frequent in records of R2L and U2R attacks. This is because the DOS and probing attacks involve many connections to some host(s) in a very short period of time, but the R2L and U2R attacks are embedded in the data portions of packets, and normally involve only a single connection.\n\nUseful algorithms for mining the unstructured data portions of packets automatically are an open research question. Stolfo et al. used domain knowledge to add features that look for suspicious behavior in the data portions, such as the number of failed login attempts. These features are called ``content'' features.\n\nA complete listing of the set of features defined for the connection records is given in the three tables below.

The KDD Cup 2009 offers the opportunity to work on large marketing databases from the French Telecom company Orange to predict the propensity of customers to switch provider (churn), buy new products or services (appetency), or buy upgrades or add-ons proposed to them to make the sale more profitable (up-selling).\nThe most practical way, in a CRM system, to build knowledge on customer is to produce scores. A score (the output of a model) is an evaluation for all instances of a target variable to explain (i.e. churn, appetency or up-selling). Tools which produce scores allow to project, on a given population, quantifiable information. The score is computed using input variables which describe instances. Scores are then used by the information system (IS), for example, to personalize the customer relationship. An industrial customer analysis platform able to build prediction models with a very large number of input variables has been developed by Orange Labs. This platform implements several processing methods for instances and variables selection, prediction and indexation based on an efficient model combined with variable selection regularization and model averaging method. The main characteristic of this platform is its ability to scale on very large datasets with hundreds of thousands of instances and thousands of variables. The rapid and robust detection of the variables that have most contributed to the output prediction can be a key factor in a marketing application.\nUp-selling (wikipedia definition): Up-selling is a sales technique whereby a salesman attempts to have the customer purchase more expensive\nitems, upgrades, or other add-ons in an attempt to make a more profitable sale.\nUp-selling usually involves marketing more profitable services or products, but up-selling can also be simply exposing the customer\nto other options he or she may not have considered previously.\nUp-selling can imply selling something additional, or selling something that is more profitable or otherwise preferable for the seller instead of the original sale.\nThe training set contains 50,000 examples.\nThe first predictive 190 variables are numerical and the last 40 predictive variables are categorical.\nThe last target variable is binary {-1,1}.", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2014-10-07T00:08:27", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/53997/KDDCup09_upselling.arff", "file_id": "53997", "default_target_attribute": "UPSELLING", "tag": ["OpenML100", "study_14"], "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "7c517e830d9ff93e5e0437e3c58d9939"}}, "300": {"data_set_description": {"id": "300", "name": "isolet", "version": "1", "description": "**Author**: Ron Cole and Mark Fanty (cole@cse.ogi.edu, fanty@cse.ogi.edu)  \n**Donor**: Tom Dietterich (tgd@cs.orst.edu)  \n**Source**: [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ISOLET)   \n**Please cite**: UCI  \n\n### Description\n\nISOLET (Isolated Letter Speech Recognition) dataset was generated as follows: 150 subjects spoke the name of each letter of the alphabet twice. Hence, there are 52 training examples from each speaker. The speakers are grouped into sets of 30 speakers each, 4 groups can serve as training set, the last group as the test set. A total of 3 examples are missing, the authors dropped them due to difficulties in recording. \n\nThis is a good domain for a noisy, perceptual task. It is also a very good domain for testing the scaling abilities of algorithms.

Pastoral damage may occur periodically over wide ranging areas. Grass grub populations are often influenced by biotic factors (diseases) and farming practices (such as irrigation and heavy rolling). The objective of the report was to report on grass grub population and damage levels to provide objective estimates of the annual losses caused by grass grubs.\n\nThe original machine learning objective was to find a relationship between grass grub numbers, irrigation and damage ranking for the period between 1986 to 1992.\n\nAttribute Information:\n1. year_zone - Years 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 divided into three zones: f, m, c - enumerated\n2. year - year of trial - enumerated\n3. strip - strip of paddock sampled - integer\n4. pdk - paddock sampled - integer\n5. damage_rankRJT - RJ Townsends damage ranking - enumerated\n6. damage_rankALL - other researchers damage ranking - enumerated\n7. dry_or_irr - indicates if paddock was dry or irrigated (D: dryland, O: irrigated overhead, B: irrigated border dyke) - enumerated\n8. zone - position of paddock (F: foothills, M: midplain, C: coastal) - enumerated\n9.

This is a proxy for the demographic background of the people: \"People with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights\". This similarity-statement is not transferable across the 51 different states.\n\nDescription from the donor of the database: \n\nThe weights on the CPS files are controlled to independent estimates of the civilian noninstitutional population of the US.  These are prepared monthly for us by Population Division here at the Census Bureau. We use 3 sets of controls. These are:\n1.  A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state.\n2.  Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex.\n3.  Controls by Race, age and sex.\n\nWe use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and \"rake\" through them 6 times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used. The term estimate refers to population totals derived from CPS by creating \"weighted tallies\" of any specified socio-economic characteristics of the population. People with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights. There is one important caveat to remember about this statement. That is that since the CPS sample is actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own probability of selection, the statement only applies within state.\n\n\n### Relevant papers  \n\nRonny Kohavi and Barry Becker.

Nine male speakers uttered two Japanese vowels /ae/ successively. For each utterance, with the analysis parameters described below, we applied 12-degree linear prediction analysis to it to obtain a discrete-time series with 12 LPC cepstrum coefficients. This means that one utterance by a speaker forms a time series whose length is in the range 7-29 and each point of a time series is of 12 features (12 coefficients).\n\nSimilar data are available for different utterances /ei/, /iu/, /uo/, /oa/ in addition to /ae/. Please contact the donor if you are interested in using this data.\n\nThe number of the time series is 640 in total. We used one set of 270 time series for training and the other set of 370 time series for testing.\n\nAnalysis parameters:  \n* Sampling rate : 10kHz\n* Frame length : 25.6 ms\n* Shift length : 6.4ms\n* Degree of LPC coefficients : 12\n\nEach line represents 12 LPC coefficients in the increasing order separated by spaces. This corresponds to one analysis\nframe. Lines are organized into blocks, which are a set of 7-29 lines separated by blank lines and corresponds to a single speech utterance of /ae/ with 7-29 frames.\n\nEach speaker is a set of consecutive blocks. In ae.train there are 30 blocks for each speaker. Blocks 1-30 represent speaker 1, blocks 31-60 represent speaker 2, and so on up to speaker 9. In ae.test, speakers 1 to 9 have the corresponding number of blocks: 31 35 88 44 29 24 40 50 29. Thus, blocks 1-31 represent speaker 1 (31 utterances of /ae/), blocks 32-66 represent speaker 2 (35 utterances of /ae/), and so on.\n\n**Past Usage**\n\nM. Kudo, J. Toyama and M. Shimbo.

(2004). \nMethods for multidimensional event classification: a case study using images from a Cherenkov gamma-ray telescope. Nucl.Instr.Meth. A, 516, pp. 511-528.  \n\nThe data are MC generated (see below) to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background). \n\nTypically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions. \n\nThe data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in: \nD. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).\nThe program was run with parameters allowing to observe events with energies down to below 50 GeV.\n\nAttribute Information:\n\n1. fLength: continuous # major axis of ellipse [mm] \n2. fWidth: continuous # minor axis of ellipse [mm] \n3. fSize: continuous # 10-log of sum of content of all pixels [in #phot] \n4. fConc: continuous # ratio of sum of two highest pixels over fSize [ratio] \n5. fConc1: continuous # ratio of highest pixel over fSize [ratio] \n6. fAsym: continuous # distance from highest pixel to center, projected onto major axis [mm] \n7. fM3Long: continuous # 3rd root of third moment along major axis [mm] \n8. fM3Trans: continuous # 3rd root of third moment along minor axis [mm] \n9. fAlpha: continuous # angle of major axis with vector to origin [deg] \n10. fDist: continuous # distance from origin to center of ellipse [mm] \n11. class: g,h # gamma (signal), hadron (background) \n\ng = gamma (signal): 12332 \nh = hadron (background): 6688 \n\nFor technical reasons, the number of h events is underestimated. In the real data, the h class represents the majority of the events. \n\nThe simple classification accuracy is not meaningful for this data, since classifying a background event as signal is worse than classifying a signal event as background. For comparison of different classifiers an ROC curve has to be used. The relevant points on this curve are those, where the probability of accepting a background event as signal is below one of the following thresholds: 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 depending on the required quality of the sample of the accepted events for different experiments.", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2014-10-07T00:42:01", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/54003/MagicTelescope.arff", "file_id": "54003", "default_target_attribute": "class:", "row_id_attribute": "ID", "tag": ["astrophysics", "gamma_rays", "mythbusting_1", "OpenML100", "study_1", "study_14", "study_15", "study_20", "study_34", "study_7"], "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "f6dee76810bd7211716fee7b2b0317cb"}}, "377": {"data_set_description": {"id": "377", "name": "synthetic_control", "version": "1", "description": "**Author**: Dr Robert Alcock (rob@skyblue.csd.auth.gr)  \n**Source**: [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Synthetic+Control+Chart+Time+Series) - 1999  \n**Please cite**:   \n\n### Description\nSynthetic Control Chart Time Series\n\n### Sources\n```\n* Original Owner and Donor\nDr Robert Alcock \nrob@skyblue.csd.auth.gr\n```\n### Dataset Information\n  \nThis data consists of synthetically generated control charts.

Is there really a home field advantage - if\nso how large is it?  Are teams that play the Monday Night game at a\ndisadvantage when they play again the following Sunday?  Do teams benefit\nfrom having a \"bye\" week off in the current schedule?  These questions and\na host of others can be investigated using this data set.\n\nHal Stern from the Statistics Department at Harvard University has\nmade available his compilation of scores for all National Football League\ngames from the 1989, 1990, and 1991 seasons.  Dr. Stern used these data as\npart of his presentation \"Who's Number One?\" in the special \"Best of\nBoston\" session at the 1992 Joint Statistics Meetings.\n\nSeveral variables in the data are keyed to the oddsmakers \"point\nspread\" for each game.  The point spread is a value assigned before each\ngame to serve as a handicap for whichever is perceived to be the better\nteam.  Thus, to win against the point spread, the \"favorite\" team must beat\nthe \"underdog\" team by more points than the spread.

Burges  \n**Source**: [MNIST Website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) - Date unknown  \n**Please cite**:  \n\nThe MNIST database of handwritten digits with 784 features, raw data available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. It can be split in a training set of the first 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples  \n\nIt is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting. The original black and white (bilevel) images from NIST were size normalized to fit in a 20x20 pixel box while preserving their aspect ratio. The resulting images contain grey levels as a result of the anti-aliasing technique used by the normalization algorithm. the images were centered in a 28x28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28x28 field.  \n\nWith some classification methods (particularly template-based methods, such as SVM and K-nearest neighbors), the error rate improves when the digits are centered by bounding box rather than center of mass. If you do this kind of pre-processing, you should report it in your publications. The MNIST database was constructed from NIST's NIST originally designated SD-3 as their training set and SD-1 as their test set. However, SD-3 is much cleaner and easier to recognize than SD-1. The reason for this can be found on the fact that SD-3 was collected among Census Bureau employees, while SD-1 was collected among high-school students. Drawing sensible conclusions from learning experiments requires that the result be independent of the choice of training set and test among the complete set of samples. Therefore it was necessary to build a new database by mixing NIST's datasets.  \n\nThe MNIST training set is composed of 30,000 patterns from SD-3 and 30,000 patterns from SD-1. Our test set was composed of 5,000 patterns from SD-3 and 5,000 patterns from SD-1. The 60,000 pattern training set contained examples from approximately 250 writers. We made sure that the sets of writers of the training set and test set were disjoint. SD-1 contains 58,527 digit images written by 500 different writers. In contrast to SD-3, where blocks of data from each writer appeared in sequence, the data in SD-1 is scrambled. Writer identities for SD-1 is available and we used this information to unscramble the writers. We then split SD-1 in two: characters written by the first 250 writers went into our new training set. The remaining 250 writers were placed in our test set. Thus we had two sets with nearly 30,000 examples each. The new training set was completed with enough examples from SD-3, starting at pattern # 0, to make a full set of 60,000 training patterns. Similarly, the new test set was completed with SD-3 examples starting at pattern # 35,000 to make a full set with 60,000 test patterns. Only a subset of 10,000 test images (5,000 from SD-1 and 5,000 from SD-3) is available on this site. The full 60,000 sample training set is available.", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2014-09-29T03:28:38", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/52667/mnist_784.arff", "file_id": "52667", "default_target_attribute": "class", "tag": ["OpenML100", "study_1", "study_41"], "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "0298d579eb1b86163de7723944c7e495"}}, "679": {"data_set_description": {"id": "679", "name": "rmftsa_sleepdata", "version": "1", "description": "**Author**:   \n**Source**: Unknown - Date unknown  \n**Please cite**:   \n\nData Sets for 'Regression Models for Time Series Analysis' by\nB.

Data appear as the STATS (Issue 10) Challenge.\n\nDATA:\n\nSubmitted by W. Robert Stephenson, Iowa State University\nemail: wrstephe@iastate.edu\n\nA manufacturer of automotive accessories provides hardware, e.g. nuts,\nbolts, washers and screws, to fasten the accessory to the car or truck.\nHardware is counted and packaged automatically.  Specifically, bolts\nare dumped into a large metal dish.  A plate that forms the bottom of\nthe dish rotates counterclockwise.  This rotation forces bolts to the\noutside of the dish and up along a narrow ledge.  Due to the vibration\nof the dish caused by the spinning bottom plate, some bolts fall off\nthe ledge and back into the dish.  The ledge spirals up to a point\nwhere the bolts are allowed to drop into a pan on a conveyor belt.\nAs a bolt drops, it passes by an electronic eye that counts it.  When\nthe electronic counter reaches the preset number of bolts, the\nrotation is stopped and the conveyor belt is moved forward.\n\nThere are several adjustments on the machine that affect its operation.\nThese include; a speed setting that controls the speed of rotation\n(SPEED1) of the plate at the bottom of the dish, a total number of\nbolts (TOTAL) to be counted, a second speed setting (SPEED2) that is\nused to change the speed of rotation (usually slowing it down) for the\nlast few bolts, the number of bolts to be counted at this second speed\n(NUMBER2), and the sensitivity of the electronic eye (SENS).  The\nsensitivity setting is to insure that the correct number of bolts are\ncounted.  Too few bolts packaged causes customer complaints.  Too many\nbolts packaged increases costs.  For each run conducted in this\nexperiment the correct number of bolts was counted.  From an\nengineering standpoint if the correct number of bolts is counted, the\nsensitivity should not affect the time to count bolts.  The measured\nresponse is the time (TIME), in seconds, it takes to count the desired\nnumber of bolts.  In order to put times on a equal footing the\nresponse to be analyzed is the time to count 20 bolts (T20BOLT).\nBelow are the data for 40 combinations of settings.  RUN is the order\nin which the data were collected.\n\nAnalyze the data.  What adjustments have the greatest effect on the\ntime to count 20 bolts?  How would you adjust the machine to get\nthe shortest time to count 20 bolts?  Are there any unusual features\nto the data?\n\nData\n\nRUN   SPEED1   TOTAL   SPEED2   NUMBER2   SENS   TIME   T20BOLT\n\n\nThe data description and data may be freely used for non-commercial\npurposes and can be freely distributed.

The objective of the mission was to obtain global mapping of the surface of Venus using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). A more detailed discussion of the mission and objectives is available at JPL's Magellan webpage. \n\nThere are some spatial dependencies. For example, background patches from with in a single image are likely to be more similar than background patches taken across different images. \n\nIn addition to the images, there are \"ground truth\" files that specify the locations of volcanoes within the images. The quotes around \"ground truth\" are intended as a reminder that there is no absolute ground truth for this data set. No one has been to Venus and the image quality does not permit 100%, unambiguous identification of the volcanoes, even by human experts. There are labels that provide some measure of subjective uncertainty (1 = definitely a volcano, 2 = probably, 3 = possibly, 4 = only a pit is visible). See reference [Smyth95] for more information on the labeling uncertainty problem. \n\nThere are also files that specify the exact set of experiments using in the published evaluations of the JARtool system. \n\n* Attribute Information:\n\nThe images are 1024X1024 pixels. The pixel values are in the range [0,255]. The pixel value is related to the amount of energy backscattered to the radar from a given spatial location. Higher pixel values indicate greater backscatter. Lower pixel values indicate lesser backscatter. Both topography and surface roughness relative to the radar wavelength affect the amount of backscatter.\n\n\n* Relevant Papers:\n\nG.H. Pettengill, P.G. Ford, W.T.K. Johnson, R.K. Raney, L.A.

Sensor readings are sampled at a rate of 9 samples per second. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that the 24 ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step, so each file has the same number of rows (one for each sampling time step). \n\nThe wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a non-linearly separable classification task. Thus, linear classifiers, such as the Perceptron network, are not able to learn the task and command the robot around the room without collisions. Nonlinear neural classifiers, such as the MLP network, are able to learn the task and command the robot successfully without collisions. \n\nIf some kind of short-term memory mechanism is provided to the neural classifiers, their performances are improved in general. For example, if past inputs are provided together with current sensor readings, even the Perceptron becomes able to learn the task and command the robot successfully. If a recurrent neural network, such as the Elman network, is used to learn the task, the resulting dynamical classifier is able to learn the task using less hidden neurons than the MLP network. \n\n* Attribute Information:\n\nNumber of Attributes: sensor_readings_24.data: 24 numeric attributes and the class. \n\nFor Each Attribute: \n-- File sensor_readings_4.data: \n1. SD_front: minimum sensor reading within a 60 degree arc located at the front of the robot - (numeric: real) \n2. SD_left: minimum sensor reading within a 60 degree arc located at the left of the robot - (numeric: real) \n3. SD_right: minimum sensor reading within a 60 degree arc located at the right of the robot - (numeric: real) \n4. SD_back: minimum sensor reading within a 60 degree arc located at the back of the robot - (numeric: real) \n5.

Ensemble members were constructed using a Latin hypercube method in LLNL's UQ Pipeline software system to sample the uncertainties of 18 model parameters within the Parallel Ocean Program (POP2) component of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4). Three separate Latin hypercube ensembles were conducted, each containing 180 ensemble members. 46 out of the 540 simulations failed for numerical reasons at combinations of parameter values. The goal is to use classification to predict simulation outcomes (fail or succeed) from input parameter values, and to use sensitivity analysis and feature selection to determine the causes of simulation crashes.

This dataset is an extension of the Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset ([Web Link]), providing now the information about the concentration level at which the sensors were exposed for each measurement. The primary purpose of making this dataset freely accessible on-line is to provide an extensive dataset to the sensor and artificial intelligence research communities to develop and test strategies to solve a wide variety of tasks, including sensor drift, classification, regression, among others. \n\nThe dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded. Citation of both Vergara et al. 'Chemical gas sensor drift compensation using classifier ensembles' and Rodriguez-Lujan et al. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the calibration of sensor arrays for pattern recognition using the minimal number of experiments\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is required (see below). \n\nThe dataset was gathered during the period of January 2008 to February 2011 (36 months) in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner, minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors. See reference 1 for more details on the experimental setup. \n\nThe resulting dataset comprises recordings from six distinct pure gaseous substances, namely Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Ethylene, Ethanol, and Toluene, dosed at a wide variety of concentration levels in the intervals (50,1000), (5,500), (12,1000), (10,300), (10,600), and (10,100) ppmv, respectively.\n\n\nAttribute Information:\n\nThe responses of the said sensors are read in the form of the resistance across the active layer of each sensor; hence, each measurement produced a 16-channel time series, each represented by an aggregate of features reflecting the dynamic processes occurring at the sensor surface in reaction to the chemical substance being evaluated. In particular, two distinct types of features were considered in the creation of this dataset: (i) the so-called steady-state feature (DR), defined as the maximal resistance change with respect to the baseline and its DR normalized version (DR divided by the acquired value when the chemical vapor is present in the test chamber). And (ii), an aggregate of features reflecting the sensor dynamics of the increasing/decaying transient portion of the sensor response during the entire measurement. This aggregate of features is a transformation, borrowed from the field of econometrics and originally introduced to the chemo-sensing community by Muezzinoglu et al. (2009), that converts the transient portion of the sensor response into a real scalar by estimating the maximum/minimum value y[k] for the rising/decaying portion of the exponential moving average of the sensor response: \n\ny[k] = (1-Alfa) y[k-1]+Alfa(R[k]-R[k-1]) \n\nwhere R[k] is the sensor resistance measured at time k and Alfa is a scalar smoothing parameter between 0 and 1. \n\nIn particular, three different values for Alfa=0.1, 0.01, 0.001 were set to obtain three different feature values from the rising portion of the sensor response and three additional features with the same Alfa values for the decaying portion of the sensor response, covering thus the entire sensor response dynamics. \n\nThus, each feature vector contains the 8 features extracted from each particular sensor, resulting in a 128-dimensional feature vector (8 features x 16 sensors) containing all the features and organized as follows: \nDR_1, |DR|_1, EMAi0.001_1, EMAi0.01_1, EMAi0.1_1, EMAd0.001_1, EMAd0.01_1, EMAd0.1_1, DR_2, |DR|_2, EMAi0.001_2, EMAi0.01_2, EMAi0.1_2, EMAd0.001_2, EMAd0.01_2, EMAd0.1_2,..., DR_16, |DR|_16, EMAi0.001_16, EMAi0.01_16, EMAi0.1_16, EMAd0.001_16, EMAd0.01_16, EMAd0.1_16 \nwhere: DR_j and |DR|_j are the R and the normalized R features, respectively. EMAi0.001_j, EMAi0.01_j, and EMAi0.1_j, are the emaR of the rising transient portion of the sensor response for Alfa 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively. EMAd0.001_j, EMAd0.01_j, and EMAd0.1_j, are emaR of the decaying transient portion of the sensor response for Alfa 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively. The index j=1\u00e2\u20ac\u00a616 represents the number of the sensor, forming thus the 128-dimensional feature vector. \n\nFor processing purposes, the dataset is organized into ten batches, each containing the number of measurements per class and month indicated in the tables below. This reorganization of data was done to ensure having a sufficient and as uniformly distributed as possible number of experiments in each batch. \n\nBatch ID Month IDs \nBatch 1 Months 1 and 2 \nBatch 2 Months 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 \nBatch 3 Months 11, 12, and 13 \nBatch 4 Months 14 and 15 \nBatch 5 Month 16 \nBatch 6 Months 17, 18, 19, and 20 \nBatch 7 Month 21 \nBatch 8 Months 22 and 23 \nBatch 9 Months 24 and 30 \nBatch 10 Month 36 \n\nBatch ID: Ethanol, Ethylene, Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Toluene \nBatch 1: 83, 30, 70, 98, 90, 74 \nBatch 2: 100, 109, 532, 334, 164, 5 \nBatch 3: 216, 240, 275, 490, 365, 0 \nBatch 4: 12, 30, 12, 43, 64, 0 \nBatch 5: 20, 46, 63, 40, 28, 0 \nBatch 6: 110, 29, 606, 574, 514, 467 \nBatch 7: 360, 744, 630, 662, 649, 568 \nBatch 8: 40, 33, 143, 30, 30, 18 \nBatch 9: 100, 75, 78, 55, 61, 101 \nBatch 10: 600, 600, 600, 600, 600, 600 \n\n\nThe dataset is organized in files, each representing a different batch. Within the files, each line represents a measurement. The first character (1-6) codes the analyte, followed by the concentration level: \n\n1: Ethanol; 2: Ethylene; 3: Ammonia; 4: Acetaldehyde; 5: Acetone; 6: Toluene \n\nThe data format follows the same coding style as in libsvm format x:v, where x stands for the feature number and v for the actual value of the feature. For example, in \n1;10.000000 1:15596.162100 2:1.868245 3:2.371604 4:2.803678 5:7.512213 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 128:-2.654529 \n\nThe number 1 stands for the class number (in this case Ethanol), the gas concentration level was 10ppmv, and the remaining 128 columns list the actual feature values for each measurement recording organized as described above.", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2015-05-22T20:18:53", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/1588716/gas-drift-different-concentrations.arff", "file_id": "1588716", "default_target_attribute": "Class", "tag": "time_series", "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "8041e13da9b6baacf6d6bb77b254566f"}}, "991": {"data_set_description": {"id": "991", "name": "car", "version": "2", "description": "**Author**:   \n**Source**: Unknown - Date unknown  \n**Please cite**:   \n\nBinarized version of the original data set (see version 1).

This is the agnostic version of a subset of the MNIST data set. We chose the problem of separating the odd numbers from even numbers. We use 2-digit numbers. Only the unit digit is informative for that task, therefore at least \u00bd of the features are distracters. This is a twoclass classification problem with sparse continuous input variables, in which each class is\ncomposed of several clusters. It is a problems with heterogeneous classes.\n\n\n### Source\n\nThe data set was constructed from the MNIST data that is made available by Yann\nLeCun of the NEC Research Institute at [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image of dimension 28x28. Examples are shown in the [documentation in chapter 3](http://clopinet.com/isabelle/Projects/agnostic/Dataset.pdf).\n\n\n### Description \n\nTo construct the \u201cagnostic\u201d dataset, we performed the following steps:\n- We removed the pixels that were 99% of the time white. This reduced the original\nfeature set of 784 pixels to 485.\n- The original resolution (256 gray levels) was kept.\n- In spite of the fact that the data are rather sparse (about 30% of the values are\nnon-zero), we saved the data as a dense matrix because we found that it can be\ncompressed better in this way (to 19 MB.)\n- The feature names are the (i,j) matrix coordinates of the pixels (in a 28x28\nmatrix.)\n- We created 2 digit numbers by dividing the datasets into to parts and pairing the\ndigits at random.\n- The task is to separate odd from even numbers. The digit of the tens being not\ninformative, the features of that digit act as distracters.\nTo construct the \u201cprior\u201d dataset, we went back to the original data and fetched the\n\u201cinformative\u201d digit in its original representation. Therefore, this data representation\nconsists in a vector of concatenating the lines of a 28x28 pixel map.\n\nData type: non-sparse  \nNumber of features: 970  \nNumber of examples and check-sums:  \nPos_ex Neg_ex Tot_ex Check_sum  \nTrain  1550  1603  3153 164947945.00  \nValid   155   160   315 16688946.00  \n\n\nThis dataset contains samples from both training and validation datasets.", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2014-10-06T23:56:01", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/53921/gina_agnostic.arff", "file_id": "53921", "default_target_attribute": "label", "tag": ["mythbusting_1", "OpenML100", "study_1", "study_14", "study_15", "study_20", "study_34", "study_41"], "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "e8b42f51e0a453e4b77c24f8e2569948"}}, "1040": {"data_set_description": {"id": "1040", "name": "sylva_prior", "version": "1", "description": "**Author**:   \n**Source**: Unknown - Date unknown  \n**Please cite**:   \n\nDatasets from the Agnostic Learning vs. Prior Knowledge Challenge (http://www.agnostic.inf.ethz.ch)\n\n**Note: Derived from the covertype dataset**\n\nDataset from: http://www.agnostic.inf.ethz.ch/datasets.php\n\nModified by TunedIT (converted to ARFF format)\n\n\nSYLVA is the ecology database\n\n\nThe task of SYLVA is to classify forest cover types.

We provide pre-computed feature vectors for each word in the eye movement trajectory, with class labels.\n\nThe dataset consist of several assignments. Each assignment consists of a question followed by ten sentences (titles of news articles). One of the sentences is the correct answer to the question (C) and five of the sentences are irrelevant to the question (I). Four of the sentences are relevant to the question (R), but they do not answer it.\n\n\n* Features are in columns, feature vectors in rows.\n* Each assignment is a time sequence of 22-dimensional feature vectors.\n* The first column is the line number, second the assignment number and the next 22 columns (3 to 24) are the different features. Columns 25 to 27 contain extra information about the example. The training data set contains the classification label in the 28th column: \"0\" for irrelevant, \"1\" for relevant and \"2\" for the correct answer.\n* Each example (row) represents a single word. You are asked to return the classification of each read sentence.\n* The 22 features provided are commonly used in psychological studies on eye movement. All of them are not necessarily relevant in this context.\n\nThe objective of the Challenge is to predict the classification labels (I, R, C).\n\n\n\nPlease see the technical report for information of eye movements, experimental setup, baseline methods and references:\n\nJarkko Salojarvi, Kai Puolamaki, Jaana Simola, Lauri Kovanen, Ilpo Kojo, Samuel Kaski.

Gunes Koru and Hongfang Liu, \"An Investigation of the Effect\nof Module Size on Defect Prediction Using Static Measures\", PROMISE -\nPredictive Models in Software Engineering Workshop, ICSE 2005,\nMay 15th 2005, Saint Louis, Missouri, US.\n\nWe used several machine learning algorithms to predict the defective\nmodules in five NASA products, namely, CM1, JM1, KC1, KC2, and PC1.\nA set of static measures were used as predictor variables. While doing\nso, we observed that a large portion of the modules were small, as\nmeasured by lines of code (LOC). When we experimented on the data\nsubsets created by partitioning according to module size, we obtained\nhigher prediction performance for the subsets that include larger\nmodules. We also performed defect prediction using class-level data\nfor KC1 rather than method-level data. In this case, the use of class-level\ndata resulted in improved prediction performance compared to using\nmethod-level data. These findings suggest that quality assurance activities\ncan be guided even better if defect predictions are made by using\ndata that belong to larger modules.\n\n5. Features:\n\nThe descriptions of the features are taken from\nhttp://mdp.ivv.nasa.gov/mdp_glossary.html\n\nFeature Used as the Response Variable:\n======================================\nDL: Defect level. DEF if the class is in the Top 5% in defect ranking, NODEF\notherwise.\n\nFeatures at Class Level Originally\n==================================\n\nPERCENT_PUB_DATA:  The percentage of data that is public and protected data\nin a class. In general, lower values indicate greater encapsulation. It is\nmeasure of encapsulation.\n\nACCESS_TO_PUB_DATA: The amount of times that a class's public and protected\ndata is accessed. In general, lower values indicate greater encapsulation.\nIt is a measure of encapsulation.\n\nCOUPLING_BETWEEN_OBJECTS: The number of distinct non-inheritance-related\nclasses on which a class depends. If a class that is heavily dependent on\nmany classes outside of its hierarchy is introduced into a library, all the\nclasses upon which it depends need to be introduced as well. This may be\nacceptable, especially if the classes which it references are already part\nof a class library and are even more fundamental than the specified class.\n\nDEPTH: The level for a class. For instance, if a parent has one child the\ndepth for the child is two. Depth indicates at what level a class is located\nwithin its class hierarchy. In general, inheritance increases when depth\nincreases.\n\nLACK_OF_COHESION_OF_METHODS: For each data field in a class, the percentage\nof the methods in the class using that data field; the percentages are\naveraged then subtracted from 100%. The locm metric indicates low or\nhigh percentage of cohesion. If the percentage is low, the class is cohesive.\nIf it is high, it may indicate that the class could be split into separate\nclasses that will individually have greater cohesion.\n\nNUM_OF_CHILDREN: The number of classes derived from a specified class.\n\nDEP_ON_CHILD: Whether a class is dependent on a descendant.\n\nFAN_IN: This is a count of calls by higher modules.\n\nRESPONSE_FOR_CLASS: A count of methods implemented within a class plus the\nnumber of methods accessible to an object class due to inheritance. In\ngeneral, lower values indicate greater polymorphism.\n\nWEIGHTED_METHODS_PER_CLASS: A count of methods implemented within a class\n(rather than all methods accessible within the class hierarchy). In general,\nlower values indicate greater polymorphism.\nFeatures Transformed to Class Level (Originally at Method Level)\n================================================================\n\nTransformation was achieved by obtaining min, max, sum, and avg values\nover all the methods in a class. There this data set includes four\nfeatures for all of the following features that were originally at the\nmethod level but transformed to the class level. For example, LOC_BLANK\nhas minLOC_BLANK, maxLOC_BLANK, avgLOC_BLANK, and maxLOC_BLANK.\n\nLOC_BLANK: Lines with only white space or no text content.\n\nBRANCH_COUNT: This metric is the number of branches for each module.\nBranches are defined as those edges that exit from a decision node.\nThe greater the number of branches in a program's modules, the more\ntesting resource's required.\n\nLOC_CODE_AND_COMMENT: Lines that contain both code and comment.\n\nLOC_COMMENTS:  The number of lines in a module. This particular metric\nincludes all blank lines, comment lines, and source lines.\n\nCYCLOMATIC_COMPLEXITY: It is a measure of the complexity of a modules\ndecision structure. It is the number of linearly independent paths.\n\nDESIGN_COMPLEXITY: Design complexity is a measure of a module's decision\nstructure as it relates to calls to other modules. This quantifies the\ntesting effort related to integration.\n\nESSENTIAL_COMPLEXITY: Essential complexity is a measure of the degree to\nwhich a module contains unstructured constructs.\n\nLOC_EXECUTABLE:  Source lines of code that contain only code and white space.\n\nHALSTEAD_CONTENT: Complexity of a given algorithm independent of the\nlanguage used to express the algorithm.\n\nHALSTEAD_DIFFICULTY: Level of difficulty in the program.\n\nHALSTEAD_EFFORT: Estimated mental effort required to develop the program.\n\nHALSTEAD_ERROR_EST:  Estimated number of errors in the program.\n\nHALSTEAD_LENGTH: This is a Halstead metric that includes the total number\nof operator occurrences and total number of operand occurrences.\n\nHALSTEAD_LEVEL: Level at which the program can be understood.\n\nHALSTEAD_PROG_TIME: Estimated amount of time to implement the algorithm.\n\nHALSTEAD_VOLUME: This is a Halstead metric that contains the minimum\nnumber of bits required for coding the program.\n\nNUM_OPERANDS: Variables and identifiers Constants (numeric literal/string)\nFunction names when used during calls.\n\nNUM_UNIQUE_OPERANDS: Variables and identifiers Constants\n(numeric literal/string) Function names when used during calls\n\nNUM_UNIQUE_OPERATORS: Number of unique operators.\n\nLOC_TOTAL: Total Lines of Code.", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2014-10-06T23:57:05", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/53928/kc1-top5.arff", "file_id": "53928", "default_target_attribute": "DL", "tag": ["mythbusting_1", "study_1", "study_15", "study_20", "study_41", "study_7", "study_88"], "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "d5ca7c0eb9d3149ebd9c8f5b9be6bbf2"}}, "1046": {"data_set_description": {"id": "1046", "name": "mozilla4", "version": "1", "description": "**Author**:   \n**Source**: Unknown - Date unknown  \n**Please cite**:   \n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\nThis is a PROMISE Software Engineering Repository data set made publicly\navailable in order to encourage repeatable, verifiable, refutable, and/or\nimprovable predictive models of software engineering.\n\nIf you publish material based on PROMISE data sets then, please\nfollow the acknowledgment guidelines posted on the PROMISE repository\nweb page http://promisedata.org/repository .\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n(c) 2007  A.

Previous research has found that\nthere is generally a positive relationship between module size and\ndefect proneness. Therefore, in open-source software development, it\nis important to monitor module size and understand its impact on\ndefect proneness. However, traditional approaches to quality\nmodeling, which measure specific system snapshots and obtain future\ndefect counts, are not well suited because open-source modules\nusually evolve and their size changes over time. In this study, we\nused Cox proportional hazards modeling with recurrent events to\nstudy the effect of class size on defect-proneness in the Mozilla\nproduct. We found that the effect of size was significant, and we\nquantified this effect on defect proneness.\n\nThe full paper can be downloaded from A.

When a\nclass is introduced to a system, a new observation is entered with start=0\n\nend: Either the time of the next modification, or the end of the\nobservation period, or the time of deletion, whichever comes first.\n\nevent: event is set to 1 if a defect fix takes place\nat the time represented by 'end', or 0 otherwise.  A class deletion\nis handled easily by entering a final observation whose event is set\nto 1 if the class is deleted for corrective maintenance, or 0 otherwise.\n\nsize: It is a time-dependent covariate and its column carries the\nnumber of source Lines of Code of the C++ classes\nat time 'start'.

Two detectors with the same accuracy can have widely varying PDs and PFs.\n\n## Relevant information\n* JM1 is written in \"C\" and is a real-time predictive ground system: Uses simulations to generate predictions\n* Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code.  These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality. The nature of association is under dispute.\n\nNotes on McCabe and Halstead follow.\n\n* The McCabe and Halstead measures are \"module\"-based where a \"module\" is the smallest unit of functionality. In C or Smalltalk, \"modules\" would be called \"function\" or \"method\" respectively.\n\n* Defect detectors can be assessed according to the following measures:\n\n    module actually has defects\n    +-------------+------------+\n    |     no      |     yes    |\n    +-----+-------------+------------+\n    classifier predicts no defects |  no |      a      |      b     |\n    +-----+-------------+------------+\n    classifier predicts some defects | yes |      c      |      d     |\n    +-----+-------------+------------+\n\n\n    accuracy                   = acc          = (a+d)/(a+b+c+d\n    probability of detection   = pd  = recall = d/(b+d)\n    probability of false alarm = pf           = c/(a+c)\n    precision                  = prec         = d/(c+d)\n    effort                     = amount of code selected by detector = (c.LOC + d.LOC)/(Total LOC)\n\n\nIdeally, detectors have high PDs, low PFs, and low effort. This ideal state rarely happens:\n\n* PD and effort are linked. The more modules that trigger the detector, the higher the PD. However, effort also gets increases\n* High PD or low PF comes at the cost of high PF or low PD (respectively). This linkage can be seen in a standard receiver operator curve (ROC).  Suppose, for example, LOC> x is used as the detector (i.e. we assume large modules have more errors). LOC > x represents a family of detectors. At x=0, EVERY module is predicted to have errors. This detector has a high PD but also a high false alarm rate. At x=0, NO module is predicted to have errors. This detector has a low false alarm rate but won't detect anything at all. At 0<x PD=PF PF=0) PD=0) PD=1,PF> but does not reach it.\n* The line pf=pd on the above graph represents the \"no information\" line. If pf=pd then the detector is pretty useless. The better the detector, the more it rises above PF=PD towards the \"sweet spot\".\n\nNOTES ON MCCABE/HALSTEAD\n========================\nMcCabe argued that code with complicated pathways are more error-prone.  His metrics therefore reflect the pathways within a code module.\n\n    @Article{mccabe76,\n    title  = \"A Complexity Measure\",\n    author  = \"T.J. McCabe\",\n    pages  = \"308--320\",\n    journal = \"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering\",\n    year  = \"1976\",\n    volume  = \"2\",\n    month  = \"December\",\n    number  = \"4\"}\n\nHalstead argued that code that is hard to read is more likely to be fault prone. Halstead estimates reading complexity by counting the number of concepts in a module; e.g. number of unique operators.\n\n    @Book{halstead77,\n    Author    = \"M.H. Halstead\",\n    Title    = \"Elements of Software Science\",\n    Publisher = \"Elsevier \",\n    Year    = 1977}\n\nWe study these static code measures since they are useful, easy to use, and widely used:\n\n* USEFUL: E.g. this data set can generate highly accurate predictors for defects\n* EASY TO USE: Static code measures (e.g. lines of code, the McCabe/Halstead measures) can be automatically and cheaply collected.\n* WIDELY USED: Many researchers use static measures to guide software quality predictions (see the reference list in the above \"blind spot\" paper. Verification and validation (V\\&V) textbooks advise using static code complexity measures to decide which modules are worthy of manual inspections.  Further, we know of several large government software contractors that won't review software modules _unless_ tools like McCabe predict that they are fault prone.  Hence, defect detectors have a major economic impact when they may force programmers to rewrite code.\n\nNevertheless, the merits of these metrics has been widely criticized.  Static code measures are hardly a complete characterization of the internals of a function. Fenton offers an insightful example where the same functionality is achieved using different programming language constructs resulting in different static measurements for that module. Fenton uses this example to argue the uselessness of static code measures.\n\n    @Book{fenton97,\n    author    = \"N.E. Fenton and S.L. Pfleeger\",\n    title     = {Software metrics: a Rigorous \\& Practical Approach},\n    publisher = {International Thompson Press},\n    year      = {1997}}\n\nAn alternative interpretation of Fenton's example is that static measures can never be a definite and certain indicator of the presence of a fault.  Rather, defect detectors based on static measures are best viewed as probabilistic statements that the frequency of faults tends to increase in code modules that trigger the detector.  By definition, such probabilistic statements will are not categorical claims with some a non-zero false alarm rate. The research challenge for data miners is to ensure that these false alarms do not cripple their learned theories.\n\nThe McCabe metrics are a collection of four software metrics: essential complexity, cyclomatic complexity, design complexity and LOC, Lines of Code.\n\n* Cyclomatic Complexity, or \"v(G)\", measures the number of \"linearly independent paths\". A set of paths is said to be linearly independent if no path in the set is a linear combination of any other paths in the set through a program's \"flowgraph\". A flowgraph is a directed graph where each node corresponds to a program statement, and each arc indicates the flow of control from one statement to another. \"v(G)\" is calculated by \"v(G) = e - n + 2\" where \"G\" is a program's flowgraph, \"e\" is the number of arcs in the flowgraph, and \"n\" is the number of nodes in the flowgraph. The standard McCabes rules (\"v(G)\">10), are used to identify fault-prone module.\n* Essential Complexity, or \"ev(G)$\" is the extent to which a flowgraph can be \"reduced\" by decomposing all the subflowgraphs of $G$ that are \"D-structured primes\". Such \"D-structured primes\" are also sometimes referred to as \"proper one-entry one-exit subflowgraphs\" (for a more thorough discussion of D-primes, see the Fenton text referenced above). \"ev(G)\" is calculated using \"ev(G)= v(G) - m\" where $m$ is the number of subflowgraphs of \"G\" that are D-structured primes.\n* Design Complexity, or \"iv(G)\", is the cyclomatic complexity of a module's reduced flowgraph.  The flowgraph, \"G\", of a module is reduced to eliminate any complexity which does not influence the interrelationship between design modules.  According to McCabe, this complexity measurement reflects the modules calling patterns to its immediate subordinate modules.\n* Lines of code is measured according to McCabe's line counting conventions.\n\nThe Halstead falls into three groups: the base measures, the derived measures, and lines of code measures.\n\n* Base measures:\n  * mu1             = number of unique operators\n  * mu2             = number of unique operands\n  * N1              = total occurrences of operators\n  * N2              = total occurrences of operands\n  * length     = N  = N1 + N2\n  * vocabulary = mu = mu1 + mu2\n  * Constants set for each function:\n  * mu1' =  2 = potential operator count (just the function name and the \"return\" operator)\n  * mu2'      = potential operand count. (the number of arguments to the module)\n\nFor example, the expression \"return max(w+x,x+y)\" has \"N1=4\" operators \"return, max, +,+)\", \"N2=4\" operands (w,x,x,y), \"mu1=3\" unique operators (return, max,+), and \"mu2=3\" unique operands (w,x,y).\n\n* Derived measures:\n  * P = volume = V = N * log2(mu) (the number of mental comparisons needed to write\na program of length N)\n  * V* = volume on minimal implementation = (2 + mu2')*log2(2 + mu2')\n  * L  = program length = V*/N\n  * D  = difficulty = 1/L\n  * L' = 1/D\n  * I  = intelligence = L'*V'\n  * E  = effort to write program = V/L\n  * T  = time to write program = E/18 seconds\n\n## Number of instances\n10885\n\n## Number of attributes\n22 (5 different lines of code measure, 3 McCabe metrics, 4 base Halstead measures, 8 derived Halstead measures, a branch-count, and 1 goal field)\n\n## Attribute Information\n1. loc             : numeric % McCabe's line count of code\n2. v(g)            : numeric % McCabe \"cyclomatic complexity\"\n3. ev(g)           : numeric % McCabe \"essential complexity\"\n4. iv(g)           : numeric % McCabe \"design complexity\"\n5. n               : numeric % Halstead total operators + operands\n6. v               : numeric % Halstead \"volume\"\n7. l               : numeric % Halstead \"program length\"\n8. d               : numeric % Halstead \"difficulty\"\n9. i               : numeric % Halstead \"intelligence\"\n10. e               : numeric % Halstead \"effort\"\n11. b               : numeric % Halstead\n12. t               : numeric % Halstead's time estimator\n13. lOCode          : numeric % Halstead's line count\n14. lOComment       : numeric % Halstead's count of lines of comments\n15. lOBlank         : numeric % Halstead's count of blank lines\n16. lOCodeAndComment: numeric\n17. uniq_Op         : numeric % unique operators\n18. uniq_Opnd       : numeric % unique operands\n19. total_Op        : numeric % total operators\n20. total_Opnd      : numeric % total operands\n21: branchCount     : numeric % of the flow graph\n22. defects         : {false,true} % module has/has not one or more reported defects\n\n## Missing attributes\nNone\n\n## Class Distribution\nThe class value (defects) is discrete\nfalse: 2106 = 19.35%\ntrue:  8779 = 80.65%", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2014-10-06T23:57:19", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/53936/jm1.arff", "file_id": "53936", "default_target_attribute": "defects", "tag": ["mythbusting_1", "OpenML100", "study_1", "study_14", "study_15", "study_20", "study_34", "study_41"], "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "0c19aefce52ccb955d0de57e4c0fe8bf"}}, "1054": {"data_set_description": {"id": "1054", "name": "mc2", "version": "1", "description": "**Author**: Mike Chapman, NASA  \n**Source**: [tera-PROMISE](http://openscience.us/repo/defect/mccabehalsted/mc2.html) - 2004  \n**Please cite**: Sayyad Shirabad, J. and Menzies, T.J.

Title: Class-level data for KC1\nThis one includes a {_TRUE,FALSE} attribute (DL) to indicate defectiveness.\n\n2. Sources\n(a) Creator: A. Gunes Koru\n(b) Date: February 21, 2005\n(c) Contact: gkoru AT umbc DOT edu Phone: +1 (410) 455 8843\n\n3. Donor: A. Gunes Koru\n\n4. Past Usage: This data was used for:\n\nA. Gunes Koru and Hongfang Liu, \"An Investigation of the Effect\nof Module Size on Defect Prediction Using Static Measures\", PROMISE -\nPredictive Models in Software Engineering Workshop, ICSE 2005,\nMay 15th 2005, Saint Louis, Missouri, US.\n\nWe used several machine learning algorithms to predict the defective\nmodules in five NASA products, namely, CM1, JM1, KC1, KC2, and PC1.\nA set of static measures were used as predictor variables. While doing\nso, we observed that a large portion of the modules were small, as\nmeasured by lines of code (LOC). When we experimented on the data\nsubsets created by partitioning according to module size, we obtained\nhigher prediction performance for the subsets that include larger\nmodules. We also performed defect prediction using class-level data\nfor KC1 rather than method-level data. In this case, the use of class-level\ndata resulted in improved prediction performance compared to using\nmethod-level data. These findings suggest that quality assurance activities\ncan be guided even better if defect predictions are made by using\ndata that belong to larger modules.\n\n5. Features:\n\nThe descriptions of the features are taken from\nhttp://mdp.ivv.nasa.gov/mdp_glossary.html\n\nFeature Used as the Response Variable:\n======================================\nDL: Defect level. _TRUE if the class contains one or more defects,\nfalse otherwise.\n\nFeatures at Class Level Originally\n==================================\n\nPERCENT_PUB_DATA:  The percentage of data that is public and protected data\nin a class. In general, lower values indicate greater encapsulation. It is\nmeasure of encapsulation.\n\nACCESS_TO_PUB_DATA: The amount of times that a class's public and protected\ndata is accessed. In general, lower values indicate greater encapsulation.\nIt is a measure of encapsulation.\n\nCOUPLING_BETWEEN_OBJECTS: The number of distinct non-inheritance-related\nclasses on which a class depends. If a class that is heavily dependent on\nmany classes outside of its hierarchy is introduced into a library, all the\nclasses upon which it depends need to be introduced as well. This may be\nacceptable, especially if the classes which it references are already part\nof a class library and are even more fundamental than the specified class.\n\nDEPTH: The level for a class. For instance, if a parent has one child the\ndepth for the child is two. Depth indicates at what level a class is located\nwithin its class hierarchy. In general, inheritance increases when depth\nincreases.\n\nLACK_OF_COHESION_OF_METHODS: For each data field in a class, the percentage\nof the methods in the class using that data field; the percentages are\naveraged then subtracted from 100%. The locm metric indicates low or\nhigh percentage of cohesion. If the percentage is low, the class is cohesive.\nIf it is high, it may indicate that the class could be split into separate\nclasses that will individually have greater cohesion.\n\nNUM_OF_CHILDREN: The number of classes derived from a specified class.\n\nDEP_ON_CHILD: Whether a class is dependent on a descendant.\n\nFAN_IN: This is a count of calls by higher modules.\n\nRESPONSE_FOR_CLASS: A count of methods implemented within a class plus the\nnumber of methods accessible to an object class due to inheritance. In\ngeneral, lower values indicate greater polymorphism.\n\nWEIGHTED_METHODS_PER_CLASS: A count of methods implemented within a class\n(rather than all methods accessible within the class hierarchy). In general,\nlower values indicate greater polymorphism.\nFeatures Transformed to Class Level (Originally at Method Level)\n================================================================\n\nTransformation was achieved by obtaining min, max, sum, and avg values\nover all the methods in a class. There this data set includes four\nfeatures for all of the following features that were originally at the\nmethod level but transformed to the class level. For example, LOC_BLANK\nhas minLOC_BLANK, maxLOC_BLANK, avgLOC_BLANK, and maxLOC_BLANK.\n\nLOC_BLANK: Lines with only white space or no text content.\n\nBRANCH_COUNT: This metric is the number of branches for each module.\nBranches are defined as those edges that exit from a decision node.\nThe greater the number of branches in a program's modules, the more\ntesting resource's required.\n\nLOC_CODE_AND_COMMENT: Lines that contain both code and comment.\n\nLOC_COMMENTS:  The number of lines in a module. This particular metric\nincludes all blank lines, comment lines, and source lines.\n\nCYCLOMATIC_COMPLEXITY: It is a measure of the complexity of a modules\ndecision structure. It is the number of linearly independent paths.\n\nDESIGN_COMPLEXITY: Design complexity is a measure of a module's decision\nstructure as it relates to calls to other modules. This quantifies the\ntesting effort related to integration.\n\nESSENTIAL_COMPLEXITY: Essential complexity is a measure of the degree to\nwhich a module contains unstructured constructs.\n\nLOC_EXECUTABLE:  Source lines of code that contain only code and white space.\n\nHALSTEAD_CONTENT: Complexity of a given algorithm independent of the\nlanguage used to express the algorithm.\n\nHALSTEAD_DIFFICULTY: Level of difficulty in the program.\n\nHALSTEAD_EFFORT: Estimated mental effort required to develop the program.\n\nHALSTEAD_ERROR_EST:  Estimated number of errors in the program.\n\nHALSTEAD_LENGTH: This is a Halstead metric that includes the total number\nof operator occurrences and total number of operand occurrences.\n\nHALSTEAD_LEVEL: Level at which the program can be understood.\n\nHALSTEAD_PROG_TIME: Estimated amount of time to implement the algorithm.\n\nHALSTEAD_VOLUME: This is a Halstead metric that contains the minimum\nnumber of bits required for coding the program.\n\nNUM_OPERANDS: Variables and identifiers Constants (numeric literal/string)\nFunction names when used during calls.\n\nNUM_UNIQUE_OPERANDS: Variables and identifiers Constants\n(numeric literal/string) Function names when used during calls\n\nNUM_UNIQUE_OPERATORS: Number of unique operators.\n\nLOC_TOTAL: Total Lines of Code.", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2014-10-06T23:57:41", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/53949/kc1-binary.arff", "file_id": "53949", "default_target_attribute": "DL", "tag": ["mythbusting_1", "study_1", "study_15", "study_20", "study_41", "study_52", "study_7", "study_88"], "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "3ad86390401b9d3d92ac1cad69bbd1f5"}}, "1067": {"data_set_description": {"id": "1067", "name": "kc1", "version": "1", "description": "**Author**: Mike Chapman, NASA  \n**Source**: [tera-PROMISE](http://openscience.us/repo/defect/mccabehalsted/kc1.html) - 2004  \n**Please cite**: Sayyad Shirabad, J. and Menzies, T.J.

Relevant information:\n\nThe DATATRIEVE product was undergoing both adaptive (DATATRIEVE was being transferred\nfrom platform OpenVMS/VAX to platform OpenVMS/Alpha) and corrective maintenance\n(failures reported from customers were being fixed) at the Gallarate (Italy)\nsite of Digital Engineering.\n\nThe DATATRIEVE product was originally developed in the BLISS language. BLISS is an\nexpression language. It is block-structured, with exception handling facilities, coroutines,\nand a macro system. It was one of the first non-assembly languages for operating system\nimplementation.. Some parts were later added or rewritten in the C language. Therefore, the\noverall structure of DATATRIEVE is composed of C functions and BLISS subroutines.\n\nThe empirical study of this data set reports only the BLISS part, by far the bigger one.\nIn what follows, we will use the term \"module\" to refer to a BLISS module, i.e., a set of\ndeclarations and subroutines usually belonging to one file. More than 100 BLISS modules\nhave been studied. It was important to the DATATRIEVE team to better understand how the\ncharacteristics of the modules and transition process were correlated with the code quality.\n\nThe objective of the data analysis was to study whether it was possible to classify modules as\nnon-faulty or faulty, based on a set of measures collected on the project.\n\n5. Number of records: 130\n6. Number of attributes: 9\n8 condition attributes\n1 decision attribute\n7. Attribute Information:\n\n1. LOC6_0: number of lines of code of module m in version 6.0.\n2. LOC6_1: number of lines of code of module m in version 6.1.\n3. AddedLOC: number of lines of code that were added to module m in version 6.1, i.e., they\nwere not present in module m in version 6.0.\n4. DeletedLOC: number of lines of code that were deleted from module m in version 6.0, i.e.,\nthey were no longer present in module m in version 6.1.\n5. DifferentBlocks: number of different blocks module m in between versions 6.0 and 6.1.\n6. ModificationRate: rate of modification of module m, i.e.,\n(AddedLOC + DeletedLOC) / (LOC6.0 + AddedLOC).\n7. ModuleKnowledge: subjective variable that expresses the project team's knowledge on\nmodule m (low or high)\n8. ReusedLOC: number of lines of code of module m in version 6.0 reused in module m in\nversion 6.1.\n9.

It will be the example of diagnosing of the acute inflammations of urinary bladder and acute nephritises. For better understanding of the problem let us consider definitions of both diseases given by medics. Acute inflammation of urinary bladder is characterised by sudden occurrence of pains in the abdomen region and the urination in form of constant urine pushing, micturition pains and sometimes lack of urine keeping. Temperature of the body is rising, however most often not above 38C. The excreted urine is turbid and sometimes bloody. At proper treatment, symptoms decay usually within several days. However, there is inclination to returns. At persons with acute inflammation of urinary bladder, we should expect that the illness will turn into protracted form.\n\nAcute nephritis of renal pelvis origin occurs considerably more often at women than at men. It begins with sudden fever, which reaches, and sometimes exceeds 40C. The fever is accompanied by shivers and one- or both-side lumbar pains, which are sometimes very strong. Symptoms of acute inflammation of urinary bladder appear very often. Quite not infrequently there are nausea and vomiting and spread pains of whole abdomen.\n\nThe data was created by a medical expert as a data set to test the expert system, which will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two  diseases of urinary system. The basis for rules detection was Rough Sets Theory. Each instance represents an potential patient. Each line of the data file starts with a digit which tells the temperature of patient.\n  \n-- Attribute lines:   \nFor example, '35,9 no no yes yes yes yes no'   \nWhere:   \n'35,9' Temperature of patient   \n'no' Occurrence of nausea   \n'no' Lumbar pain   \n'yes' Urine pushing (continuous need for urination)   \n'yes' Micturition pains   \n'yes' Burning of urethra, itch, swelling of urethra outlet   \n'yes' decision: Inflammation of urinary bladder   \n'no' decision: Nephritis of renal pelvis origin    \n\n*  Attribute Information:\n  \na1 Temperature of patient { 35C-42C }    \na2 Occurrence of nausea { yes, no }   \na3 Lumbar pain { yes, no }   \na4 Urine pushing (continuous need for urination) { yes, no }   \na5 Micturition pains { yes, no }   \na6 Burning of urethra, itch, swelling of urethra outlet { yes, no }   \nd1 decision: Inflammation of urinary bladder { yes, no }   \nd2 decision: Nephritis of renal pelvis origin { yes, no }   \n\n\n* Relevant Papers:\n\nJ.Czerniak, H.Zarzycki, Application of rough sets in the presumptive diagnosis of urinary system diseases, Artificial Intelligence and Security in Computing Systems, ACS'2002 9th International Conference Proceedings, Kluwer Academic Publishers,2003, pp. 41-51", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2015-05-20T20:10:31", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/1584100/acute-inflammations.arff", "file_id": "1584100", "default_target_attribute": "Class", "tag": ["study_50", "study_52", "study_7", "study_88"], "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "725a1e0028f7bd95bfff5e567b2807a2"}}, "1457": {"data_set_description": {"id": "1457", "name": "amazon-commerce-reviews", "version": "1", "description": "**Author**: Zhi Liu  \n**Source**: UCI\n**Please cite**:   \n\nDataset creator and donator: Zhi Liu, e-mail: liuzhi8673 '@' gmail.com, institution: National Engineering Research Center for E-Learning, Hubei Wuhan, China\n\nData Set Information:\n \ndataset are derived from the customers reviews in Amazon Commerce Website for authorship identification.

Collecting information to form database is done by questionnaire. This questionnaire is provided as oral, written and also programming of a website which includes an internet questionnaire and the users can answer the questions as they wish. They entered their used websites, blogs and social networks during the day. After collecting questionnaires, the wed addresses are gathered to get expected results. And finally, their trustfulness is checked by analyzing their used web pages. As the results were same, for getting better and noiseless response, they will put in database.\n  \nAttribute Information:\n \nWe considered the following parameters as questions: age,  education, political attitudes, blog topic, and the type of the identity in internet, the influence of manager inefficiency on tendency, the effect of inefficient media on tendency, the effects of social and political conditions on tendency and finally the effect of poverty in the province on tendency. The noisy or too detailed data in database makes us far from to get proper and suitable answers of algorithms [8]. We preprocessed the data and eliminated some non-relevant data. Finally the followings are considered as the main fields which include: education, political caprice, topics, local media turnover (LMT) and local, political and social space (LPSS). \n\nThe collected data are shown in Table 1. In order to get correct answer, we classify bloggers to two groups: professional bloggers and seasonal (temporary) bloggers. Professional bloggers are those who adopt blog as an effective digital media and interested in digital writing in continuous time intervals. Seasonal (temporary) bloggers are not professional and follow blogging in discrete time periods. In this study, we review the tendency factors considering whether these people are among professional bloggers (Pro Bloggers, PB) and then, consider the other factors according to it.", "format": "ARFF", "upload_date": "2015-05-21T22:45:55", "licence": "Public", "url": "https://www.openml.org/data/v1/download/1586224/blogger.arff", "file_id": "1586224", "default_target_attribute": "Class", "tag": ["study_52", "study_7", "study_88"], "visibility": "public", "status": "active", "md5_checksum": "8163aa79215d09b9685aaacffbbf3de3"}}, "1465": {"data_set_description": {"id": "1465", "name": "breast-tissue", "version": "1", "description": "**Author**: JP Marques de S\u00e1, J Jossinet  \n**Source**: UCI    \n**Please cite**:     \n\n* Source:\n  \nJP Marques de S\u00e1, INEB-Instituto de Engenharia Biom\u00e9dica, Porto, Portugal; e-mail: jpmdesa '@' gmail.com \nJ Jossinet, inserm, Lyon, France\n\n* Data Set Information:\n  \nImpedance measurements were made at the frequencies: 15.625, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000 KHz Impedance measurements of freshly excised breast tissue were made at the following frequencies: 15.625, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000 KHz.
